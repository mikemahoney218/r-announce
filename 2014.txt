CHANGES IN R 3.0.3:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * On Windows there is support for making .texi manuals using
      texinfo 5.0 or later: the setting is in file
      src/gnuwin32/MkRules.dist.

      A packaging of the Perl script and modules for texinfo 5.2 has
      been made available at <URL:
      http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/>.

    * write.table() now handles matrices of 2^31 or more elements, for
      those with large amounts of patience and disc space.

    * There is a new function, La_version(), to report the version of
      LAPACK in use.

    * The HTML version of 'An Introduction to R' now has links to PNG
      versions of the figures.

    * There is some support to produce manuals in ebook formats. (See
      doc/manual/Makefile.  Suggested by Mauro Cavalcanti.)

    * On a Unix-alike Sys.timezone() returns NA if the environment
      variable TZ is unset, to distinguish it from an empty string
      which on some OSes means the UTC time zone.

    * The backtick may now be escaped in strings, to allow names
      containing them to be constructed, e.g. `\``.  (PR#15621)

    * read.table(), readLines() and scan() now warn when an embedded
      nul is found in the input.  (Related to PR#15625 which was
      puzzled by the behaviour in this unsupported case.)

    * (Windows only.)  file.symlink() works around the undocumented
      restriction of the Windows system call to backslashes.  (Wish of
      PR#15631.)

    * KalmanForecast(fast = FALSE) is now the default, and the help
      contains an example of how fast = TRUE can be used in this
      version.  (The usage will change in 3.1.0.)

    * strptime() now checks the locale only when locale-specific
      formats are used and caches the locale in use: this can halve the
      time taken on OSes with slow system functions (e.g. OS X).

    * strptime() and the format() methods for classes "POSIXct",
      "POSIXlt" and "Date" recognize strings with marked encodings:
      this allows, for example, UTF-8 French month names to be read on
      (French) Windows.

    * iconv(to = "utf8") is now accepted on all platforms (some
      implementations did already, but GNU libiconv did not: however
      converted strings were not marked as being in UTF-8).  The
      official name, "UTF-8" is still preferred.

    * available.packages() is better protected against corrupt metadata
      files.  (A recurring problem with Debian package shogun-r:
      PR#14713.)

    * Finalizers are marked to be run at garbage collection, but run
      only at a somewhat safer later time (when interrupts are
      checked).  This circumvents some problems with finalizers running
      arbitrary code during garbage collection (the known instances
      being running options() and (C-level) path.expand()
      re-entrantly).

  INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

    * The included version of PCRE has been updated to 8.34.  This
      fixes bugs and makes the behaviour closer to Perl 5.18.  In
      particular, the concept of 'space' includes VT and hence agrees
      with POSIX's.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * The new field SysDataCompression in the DESCRIPTION file allows
      user control over the compression used for sysdata.rda objects in
      the lazy-load database.

    * install.packages(dependencies = value) for value = NA (the
      default) or value = TRUE omits packages only in LinkingTo for
      binary package installs.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The long undocumented remapping of rround() to Rf_fround() in
      header Rmath.h is now formally deprecated: use fround() directly.

    * Remapping of prec() and trunc() in the Rmath.h header has been
      disabled in C++ code (it has caused breakage with libc++
      headers).

  BUG FIXES:

    * getParseData() truncated the imaginary part of complex number
      constants.  (Reported by Yihui Xie.)

    * dbeta(x, a, b) with a or b within a factor of 2 of the largest
      representable number could infinite-loop.  (Reported by Ioannis
      Kosmidis.)

    * provideDimnames() failed for arrays with a 0 dimension.
      (PR#15465)

    * rbind() and cbind() did not handle list objects correctly.
      (PR#15468)

    * replayPlot() now checks if it is replaying a plot from the same
      session.

    * rasterImage() and grid.raster() now give error on an empty
      (zero-length) raster.  (Reported by Ben North.)

    * plot.lm() would sometimes scramble the labels in plot type 5.
      (PR#15458 and PR#14837)

    * min() did not handle NA_character_ values properly.  (Reported by
      Magnus Thor Torfason.)

    * (Windows only.)  readRegistry() would duplicate default values
      for keys.  (PR#15455)

    * str(..., strict.width = "cut") did not handle it properly when
      more than one line needed to be cut.  (Reported by Gerrit
      Eichner.)

    * Removing subclass back-references when S4 classes were removed or
      their namespace unloaded had several bugs (e.g., PR#15481).

    * aggregate() could fail when there were too many levels present in
      the by argument.  (PR#15004)

    * namespaceImportFrom() needed to detect primitive functions when
      checking for duplicated imports (reported by Karl Forner).

    * getGraphicsEvent() did not exit when a user closed the graphics
      window.  (PR#15208)

    * Errors in vignettes were not always captured and displayed
      properly.  (PR#15495)

    * contour() could fail when dealing with extremely small z values.
      (PR#15454)

    * Several functions did not handle zero-length vectors properly,
      including browseEnv(), format(), gl(), relist() and
      summary.data.frame().  (E.g., PR#15499)

    * Sweave() did not restore the R output to the console if it was
      interrupted by a user in the middle of evaluating a code chunk.
      (Reported by Michael Sumner.)

    * Fake installs of packages with vignettes work again.

    * Illegal characters in the input caused parse() (and thus
      source()) to segfault.  (PR#15518)

    * The nonsensical use of nmax = 1 in duplicated() or unique() is
      now silently ignored.

    * qcauchy(p, *) is now fully accurate even when p is very close to
      1. (PR#15521)

    * The validmu() and valideta() functions in the standard glm()
      families now also report non-finite values, rather than failing.

    * Saved vignette results (in a .Rout.save file) were not being
      compared to the new ones during R CMD check.

    * Double-clicking outside of the list box (e.g. on the scrollbar)
      of a Tk listbox widget generated by tk_select.list() no longer
      causes the window to close. (PR#15407)

    * Improved handling of edge cases in parallel::splitindices().
      (PR#15552)

    * HTML display of results from help.search() and ?? sometimes
      contained badly constructed links.

    * c() and related functions such as unlist() converted raw vectors
      to invalid logical vectors. (PR#15535)

    * (Windows only) When a call to system2() specified one of stdin,
      stdout or stderr to be a file, but the command was not found
      (e.g. it contained its arguments, or the program was not on the
      PATH), it left the file open and unusable until R terminated.
      (Reported by Mathew McLean.)

    * The bmp() device was not recording res = NA correctly: it is now
      recorded as 72 ppi.

    * Several potential problems with compiler-specific behaviour have
      been identified using the 'Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer' in
      conjunction with the clang compiler.

    * hcl() now honours NA inputs (previously they were mapped to
      black).

    * Some translations in base packages were being looked up in the
      main catalog rather than that for the package.

    * As a result of the 3.0.2 change about 'the last second before the
      epoch', most conversions which should have given NA returned that
      time.  (The platforms affected include Linux and OS X, but not
      Windows nor Solaris.)

    * rowsum() has more support for matrices and dataframes with 2^31
      or more elements. (PR#15587)

    * predict(<lm object>, interval = "confidence", scale =
      <something>) now works.  (PR#15564)

    * The bug fix in 3.0.2 for PR#15411 was too aggressive, and
      sometimes removed spaces that should not have been removed.
      (PR#15583)

    * Running R code in a tcltk callback failed to set the busy flag,
      which will be needed to tell OS X not to 'App Nap'.

    * The code for date-times before 1902 assumed that the offset from
      GMT in 1902 was a whole number of minutes: that was not true of
      Paris (as recorded on some platforms).

    * Using Sys.setlocale to set LC_NUMERIC to "C" (to restore the sane
      behavior) no longer gives a warning.

    * deparse() now deparses complex vectors in a way that re-parses to
      the original values.  (PR#15534, patch based on code submitted by
      Alex Bertram.)

    * In some extreme cases (more than 10^15) integer inputs to
      dpqrxxx() functions might have been rounded up by one (with a
      warning about being non-integer).  (PR#15624)

    * Plotting symbol pch = 14 had the triangle upside down on some
      devices (typically screen devices). The triangle is supposed to
      be point up.  (Reported by Bill Venables.)

    * getSrcref() did not work on method definitions if
      rematchDefinition() had been used.

    * KalmanForecast(fast = FALSE) reported a (harmless) stack
      imbalance.

    * The count of observations used by KalmanRun() did not take
      missing values into account.

    * In locales where the abbreviated name of one month is a partial
      match for the full name of a later one, the %B format in
      strptime() could fail.  An example was French on OS X, where juin
      is abbreviated to jui and partially matches juillet.  Similarly
      for weekday names.

    * pbeta(x, a, b, log.p = TRUE) sometimes underflowed to zero for
      very small and very differently sized a, b.  (PR#15641)

    * approx() and approxfun() now handle infinite values with the
      "constant" method. (PR#15655)

    * stripchart() again respects reversed limits in xlim and ylim.
      (PR#15664)

CHANGES IN R 3.1.0:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * type.convert() (and hence by default read.table()) returns a
      character vector or factor when representing a numeric input as a
      double would lose accuracy.  Similarly for complex inputs.

      If a file contains numeric data with unrepresentable numbers of
      decimal places that are intended to be read as numeric, specify
      colClasses in read.table() to be "numeric".

    * tools::Rdiff(useDiff = FALSE) is closer to the POSIX definition
      of diff -b (as distinct from the description in the man pages of
      most systems).

    * New function anyNA(), a version of any(is.na(.)) which is fast
      for atomic vectors, based on a proposal by Tim Hesterberg. (Wish
      of PR#15239.)

    * arrayInd(*, useNames = TRUE) and, analogously, which(*, arr.ind =
      TRUE) now make use of names(.dimnames) when available.

    * is.unsorted() now also works for raw vectors.

    * The "table" method for as.data.frame() (also useful as
      as.data.frame.table()) now passes sep and base arguments to
      provideDimnames().

    * uniroot() gets new optional arguments, notably extendInt,
      allowing to auto-extend the search interval when needed.  The
      return value has an extra component, init.it.

    * switch(f, ...) now warns when f is a factor, as this typically
      happens accidentally where the useR meant to pass a character
      string, but f is treated as integer (as always documented).

    * The parser has been modified to use less memory.

    * The way the unary operators (+ - !) handle attributes is now more
      consistent.  If there is no coercion, all attributes (including
      class) are copied from the input to the result: otherwise only
      names, dims and dimnames are.

    * colorRamp() and colorRampPalette() now allow non-opaque colours
      and a ramp in opacity via the new argument alpha = TRUE.
      (Suggested by Alberto Krone-Martins, but optionally as there are
      existing uses which expect only RGB values.)

    * grid.show.layout() and grid.show.viewport() get an optional vp.ex
      argument.

    * There is a new function find_gs_cmd() in the tools package to
      locate a GhostScript executable.  (This is an enhanced version of
      a previously internal function there.)

    * object.size() gains a format() method.

    * There is a new family, "ArialMT", for the pdf() and postscript()
      devices.  This will only be rendered correctly on viewers which
      have access to Monotype TrueType fonts (which are sometimes
      requested by journals).

    * The text and PDF news files, including NEWS and NEWS.2, have been
      moved to the doc directory.

    * combn(x, simplify = TRUE) now gives a factor result for factor
      input x (previously user error).  (Related to PR#15442.)

    * Added utils::fileSnapshot() and utils::changedFiles() functions
      to allow snapshots and comparison of directories of files.

    * make.names(names, unique=TRUE) now tries to preserve existing
      names. (Suggestion of PR#15452.)

    * New functions cospi(x), sinpi(x), and tanpi(x), for more accurate
      computation of cos(pi*x), etc, both in R and the C API.  Using
      these gains accuracy in some cases, e.g., inside lgamma() or
      besselI().  (Suggested by Morten Welinder in PR#15529.)

    * print.table(x, zero.print = ".") now also has an effect when x is
      not integer-valued.

    * There is more support to explore the system's idea of time-zone
      names.  Sys.timezone() tries to give the current system setting
      by name (and succeeds at least on Linux, OS X, Solaris and
      Windows), and OlsonNames() lists the names in the system's Olson
      database. Sys.timezone(location = FALSE) gives the previous
      behaviour.

    * Platforms with a 64-bit time_t type are allowed to handle
      conversions between the "POSIXct" and "POSIXlt" classes for
      date-times outside the 32-bit range (before 1902 or after 2037):
      the existing workarounds are used on other platforms.  (Note that
      time-zone information for post-2037 is speculative at best, and
      the OS services are tested for known errors and so not used on OS
      X.)

      Currently time_t is usually long and hence 64-bit on Unix-alike
      64-bit platforms: however it several cases the time-zone database
      is 32-bit.  On R for Windows it is 64-bit (for both architectures
      as from this version).

    * The "save.defaults" option can include a value for
      compression_level.  (Wish of PR#15579.)

    * colSums() and friends now have support for arrays and data-frame
      columns with 2^31 or more elements.

    * as.factor() is faster when f is an unclassed integer vector (for
      example, when called from tapply()).

    * fft() now works with longer inputs, from the 12 million
      previously supported up to 2 billion.  (PR#15593)

    * Complex svd() now uses LAPACK subroutine ZGESDD, the complex
      analogue of the routine used for the real case.

    * Sweave now outputs .tex files in UTF-8 if the input encoding is
      declared to be UTF-8, regardless of the local encoding.  The
      UTF-8 encoding may now be declared using a LaTeX comment
      containing the string %\SweaveUTF8 on a line by itself.

    * file.copy() gains a copy.date argument.

    * Printing of date-times will make use of the time-zone
      abbreviation in use at the time, if known.  For example, for
      Paris pre-1940 this could be LMT, PMT, WET or WEST.  To enable
      this, the "POSIXlt" class has an optional component "zone"
      recording the abbreviation for each element.

      For platforms which support it, there is also a component
      "gmtoff" recording the offset from GMT where known.

    * (On Windows, by default on OS X and optionally elsewhere.)  The
      system C function strftime has been replaced by a more
      comprehensive version with closer conformance to the POSIX 2008
      standard.

    * dnorm(x, log = FALSE) is more accurate (but somewhat slower) for
      |x| > 5; as suggested in PR#15620.

    * Some versions of the tiff() device have further compression
      options.

    * read.table(), readLines() and scan() have a new argument to
      influence the treatment of embedded nuls.

    * Avoid duplicating the right hand side values in complex
      assignments when possible.  This reduces copying of replacement
      values in expressions such as Z$a <- a0 and ans[[i]] <- tmp: some
      package code has relied on there being copies.

      Also, a number of other changes to reduce copying of objects; all
      contributed by or based on suggestions by Michael Lawrence.

    * The fast argument of KalmanLike(), KalmanRun() and
      KalmanForecast() has been replaced by update, which instead of
      updating mod in place, optionally returns the updated model in an
      attribute "mod" of the return value.

    * arima() and makeARIMA() get a new optional argument SSinit,
      allowing the choice of a different *s*tate *s*pace initialization
      which has been observed to be more reliable close to
      non-stationarity: see PR#14682.

    * warning() has a new argument noBreaks., to simplify
      post-processing of output with options(warn = 1).

    * pushBack() gains an argument encoding, to support reading of
      UTF-8 characters using scan(), read.table() and related functions
      in a non-UTF-8 locale.

    * all.equal.list() gets a new argument use.names which by default
      labels differing components by names (if they match) rather than
      by integer index.  Saved R output in packages may need to be
      updated.

    * The methods for all.equal() and attr.all.equal() now have
      argument check.attributes after ... so it cannot be partially nor
      positionally matched (as it has been, unintentionally).

      A side effect is that some previously undetected errors of
      passing empty arguments (no object between commas) to all.equal()
      are detected and reported.

      There are explicit checks that check.attributes is logical,
      tolerance is numeric and scale is NULL or numeric.  This catches
      some unintended positional matching.

      The message for all.equal.numeric() reports a "scaled difference"
      only for scale != 1.

    * all.equal() now has a "POSIXt" method replacing the "POSIXct"
      method.

    * The "Date" and "POSIXt" methods of seq() allows by = "quarter"
      for completeness (by = "3 months" always worked).

    * file.path() removes any trailing separator on Windows, where they
      are invalid (although sometimes accepted).  This is intended to
      enhance the portability of code written by those using POSIX file
      systems (where a trailing / can be used to confine path matching
      to directories).

    * New function agrepl() which like grepl() returns a logical
      vector.

    * fifo() is now supported on Windows. (PR#15600)

    * sort.list(method = "radix") now allows negative integers (wish of
      PR#15644).

    * Some functionality of print.ts() is now available in
      .preformat.ts() for more modularity.

    * mcparallel() gains an option detach = TRUE which allows execution
      of code independently of the current session.  It is based on a
      new estranged = TRUE argument to mcfork() which forks child
      processes such that they become independent of the parent
      process.

    * The pdf() device omits circles and text at extremely small sizes,
      since some viewers were failing on such files.

    * The rightmost break for the "months", "quarters" and "years"
      cases of hist.POSIXlt() has been increased by a day.  (Inter
      alia, fixes PR#15717.)

    * The handling of DF[i,] <- a where i is of length 0 is improved.
      (Inter alia, fixes PR#15718.)

    * hclust() gains a new method "ward.D2" which implements Ward's
      method correctly.  The previous "ward" method is "ward.D" now,
      with the old name still working.  Thanks to research and
      proposals by Pierre Legendre.

    * The sunspot.month dataset has been amended and updated from the
      official source, whereas the sunspots and sunspot.year datasets
      will remain immutable. The documentation and source links have
      been updated correspondingly.

    * The summary() method for "lm" fits warns if the fit is
      essentially perfect, as most of the summary may be computed
      inaccurately (and with platform-dependent values).

      Programmers who use summary() in order to extract just a
      component which will be reliable (e.g. $cov.unscaled) should wrap
      their calls in suppressWarnings().

  INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

    * The included version of LAPACK has been updated to 3.5.0.

    * There is some support for parallel testing of an installation, by
      setting TEST_MC_CORES to an integer greater than one to indicate
      the maximum number of cores to be used in parallel. (It is worth
      specifying at least 8 cores if available.)  Most of these require
      a make program (such as GNU make and dmake) which supports the
      $MAKE -j nproc syntax.

      Except on Windows: the tests of standard package examples in make
      check are done in parallel.  This also applies to running
      tools::testInstalledPackages().

      The more time-consuming regression tests are done in parallel.

      The package checks in make check-devel and make check-recommended
      are done in parallel.

    * More of make check will work if recommended packages are not
      installed: but recommended packages remain needed for thorough
      checking of an R build.

    * The version of tzcode included in src/extra/tzone has been
      updated.  (Formerly used only on Windows.)

    * The included (64-bit) time-zone conversion code and Olson
      time-zone database can be used instead of the system version: use
      configure option --with-internal-tzcode.  This is the default on
      Windows and OS X.  (Note that this does not currently work if a
      non-default rsharedir configure variable is used.)

      (It might be necessary to set environment variable TZ on OSes
      where this is not already set, although the system timezone is
      deduced correctly on at least Linux, OS X and Windows.)

      This option also switches to the version of strftime included in
      directory src/extra/tzone.

    * configure now tests for a C++11-compliant compiler by testing
      some basic features.  This by default tries flags for the
      compiler specified by CXX, but an alternative compiler, options
      and standard can be specified by variables CXX1X, CXX1XFLAGS and
      CXX1XSTD (e.g. -std=gnu++11).

    * R can now optionally be compiled to use reference counting
      instead of the NAMED mechanism by defining SWITCH_TO_REFCNT in
      Rinternals.h. This may become the default in the future.

    * There is a new option --use-system-tre to use a suitable system
      tre library: at present this means a version from their git
      repository, after corrections.  (Wish of PR#15660.)

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * The CRANextra repository is no longer a default repository on
      Windows: all the binary versions of packages from CRAN are now on
      CRAN, although CRANextra contains packages from Omegahat and
      elsewhere used by CRAN packages.

    * Only vignettes sources in directory vignettes are considered to
      be vignettes and hence indexed as such.

    * In the DESCRIPTION file,

          License: X11

      is no longer recognized as valid.  Use MIT or BSD_2_clause
      instead, both of which need + file LICENSE.

    * For consistency, entries in .Rinstignore are now matched
      case-insensitively on all platforms.

    * Help for S4 methods with very long signatures now tries harder to
      split the description in the Usage field to no more than 80
      characters per line (some packages had over 120 characters).

    * R CMD INSTALL --build (not Windows) now defaults to the internal
      tar() unless R_INSTALL_TAR is set.

    * There is support for compiling C++11 code in packages on suitable
      platforms: see 'Writing R Extensions'.

    * Fake installs now install the contents of directory inst: some
      packages use this to install e.g. C++ headers for use by other
      packages that are independent of the package itself.  Option
      --no-inst can be used to get the previous behaviour.

  DEBUGGING:

    * The behaviour of the code browser has been made more consistent,
      in part following the suggestions in PR#14985.

    * Calls to browser() are now consistent with calls to the browser
      triggered by debug(), in that Enter will default to n rather than
      c.

    * A new browser command s has been added, to "step into" function
      calls.

    * A new browser command f has been added, to "finish" the current
      loop or function.

    * Within the browser, the command help will display a short list of
      available commands.

  UTILITIES:

    * Only vignettes sources in directory vignettes are considered to
      be vignettes by R CMD check.  That has been the preferred
      location since R 2.14.0 and is now obligatory.

    * For consistency, R CMD build now matches entries in .Rbuildignore
      and vignettes/.install_extras case-insensitively on all platforms
      (not just on Windows).

    * checkFF() (called by R CMD check by default) can optionally check
      foreign function calls for consistency with the registered type
      and argument count.  This is the default for R CMD check
      --as-cran or can be enabled by setting environment variable
      _R_CHECK_FF_CALLS_ to registration (but is in any case suppressed
      by --install=no).  Because this checks calls in which .NAME is an
      R object and not just a literal character string, some other
      problems are detected for such calls.

      Functions suppressForeignCheck() and dontCheck() have been added
      to allow package authors to suppress false positive reports.

    * R CMD check --as-cran warns about a false value of the
      DESCRIPTION field BuildVignettes for Open Source packages, and
      ignores it.  (An Open Source package needs to have complete
      sources for its vignettes which should be usable on a suitably
      well-equipped system).

    * R CMD check --no-rebuild-vignettes is defunct:
      R CMD check --no-build-vignettes has been preferred since R
      3.0.0.

    * R CMD build --no-vignettes is defunct:
      R CMD build --no-build-vignettes has been preferred since R
      3.0.0.

    * R CMD Sweave and R CMD Stangle now process both Sweave and
      non-Sweave vignettes.  The tools::buildVignette() function has
      been added to do the same tasks from within R.

    * The flags returned by R CMD config --ldflags and (where
      installed) pkg-config --libs libR are now those needed to link a
      front-end against the (shared or static) R library.

    * Sweave.sty has a new option [inconsolata].

    * R CMD check customizations such as _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_ make
      available packages only in LinkingTo only for installation, and
      not for loading/runtime tests.

    * tools::checkFF() reports on .C and .Fortran calls with DUP =
      FALSE if argument check_DUP is true.  This is selected by R CMD
      check by default.

    * R CMD check --use-gct can be tuned to garbage-collect less
      frequently using gctorture2() _via_ the setting of environment
      variable _R_CHECK_GCT_N_.

    * Where supported, tools::texi2dvi() limits the number of passes
      tried to 20.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * (Windows only) A function R_WaitEvent() has been added (with
      declaration in headerR.h) to block execution until the next event
      is received by R.

    * Remapping in the Rmath.h header can be suppressed by defining
      R_NO_REMAP_RMATH.

    * The remapping of rround() in header Rmath.h has been removed: use
      fround() instead.

    * ftrunc() in header Rmath.h is now a wrapper for the C99 function
      trunc(), which might as well be used in C code: ftrunc() is still
      needed for portable C++ code.

    * The never-documented remapping of prec() to fprec() in header
      Rmath.h has been removed.

    * The included LAPACK subset now contains ZGESDD and ZGELSD.

    * The function LENGTH() now checks that it is only applied to
      vector arguments.  However, in packages length() should be used.
      (In R itself LENGTH() is a macro without the function overhead of
      length().)

    * Calls to SET_VECTOR_ELT() and SET_STRING_ELT() are now checked
      for indices which are in-range: several packages were writing one
      element beyond the allocated length.

    * allocVector3 has been added which allows custom allocators to be
      used for individual vector allocations.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * chol(pivot = TRUE, LINPACK = TRUE) is defunct.

      Arguments EISPACK for eigen() and LINPACK for chol(), chol2inv(),
      solve() and svd() are ignored: LAPACK is always used.

    * .find.package() and .path.package() are defunct: only the
      versions without the initial dot introduced in R 2.13.0 have ever
      been in the API.

    * Partial matching when using the $ operator _on data frames_ now
      throws a warning and may become defunct in the future. If partial
      matching is intended, replace foo$bar by foo[["bar", exact =
      FALSE]].

    * The long-deprecated use of \synopsis in the Usage section of .Rd
      files has been removed: such sections are now ignored (with a
      warning).

    * package.skeleton()'s deprecated argument namespace has been
      removed.

    * Many methods are no longer exported by package stats.  They are
      all registered on their generic, which should be called rather
      than calling a method directly.

    * Functions readNEWS() and checkNEWS() in package tools are
      defunct.

    * download.file(method = "lynx") is deprecated.

    * .C(DUP = FALSE) and .Fortran(DUP = FALSE) are now deprecated, and
      may be disabled in future versions of R.  As their help has long
      said, .Call() is much preferred.

      R CMD check notes such usages (by default).

    * The workaround of setting R_OSX_VALGRIND has been removed: it is
      not needed in current valgrind.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Calling lm.wfit() with no non-zero weights gave an array-overrun
      in the Fortran code and a not very sensible answer.  It is now
      special-cased with a simpler answer (no qr component).

    * Error messages involving non-syntactic names (e.g. as produced by
      `\r` when that object does not exist) now encode the control
      characters.  (Reported by Hadley Wickham.)

    * getGraphicsEvent() caused 100% usage of one CPU in Windows.
      (PR#15500)

    * nls() with no start argument may now work inside another function
      (scoping issue).

    * pbeta() and similar work better for very large (billions) ncp.

    * Where time zones have changed abbreviations over the years, the
      software tries to more consistently use the abbreviation
      appropriate to the time or if that is unknown, the current
      abbreviation.  On some platforms where the C function localtime
      changed the tzname variables the reported abbreviation could have
      been that of the last time converted.

    * all.equal(list(1), identity) now works.

    * Bug fix for pushing viewports in grid (reported by JJ Allaire and
      Kevin Ushey).

      NOTE for anyone poking around within the graphics engine display
      list (despite the warnings not to) that this changes what is
      recorded by grid on the graphics engine display list.

    * Extra checks have been added for unit resolution and conversion
      in grid, to catch instances of division-by-zero.  This may
      introduce error messages in existing code and/or produce a
      different result in existing code (but only where a non-finite
      location or dimension may now become zero).

    * Some bugs in TRE have been corrected by updating from the git
      repository.  This allows R to be installed on some platforms for
      which this was a blocker (PR#15087 suggests Linux on ARM and
      HP-UX).

    * ? applied to a call to an S4 generic failed in several cases.
      (PR#15680)
      which this was a blocker (PR#15087 suggests Linux on ARM and
      HP-UX).

    * ? applied to a call to an S4 generic failed in several cases.
      (PR#15680)

    * The implicit S4 generics for primitives with ... in their
      argument list were incorrect. (PR#15690)

    * Bug fixes to methods::callGeneric(). (PR#15691)

    * The bug fix to aggregrate() in PR#15004 introduced a new bug in
      the case of no grouping variables. (PR#15699)

    * In rare cases printing deeply nested lists overran a buffer by
      one byte and on a few platforms segfaulted. (PR#15679)

    * The dendrogram method of as.dendrogram() was hidden accidentally,
      (PR#15703), and order.dendrogram(d) gave too much for a leaf d.
      (PR#15702)

    * R would try to kill processes on exit that have pids ever used by
      a child process spawned by mcparallel even though the current
      process with that pid was not actually its child.

    * cophenetic() applied to a "dendrogram" object sometimes
      incorrectly returned a "Labels" attribute with dimensions.
      (PR#15706)

    * printCoefmat() called from quite a few print() methods now obeys
      small getOption("width") settings, line wrapping the "signif.
      codes" legend appropriately.  (PR#15708)

    * model.matrix() assumed that the stored dimnames for a matrix was
      NULL or length 2, but length 1 occurred.

    * The clipping region for a device was sometimes used in base
      graphics before it was set.

Subject: [R] R 3.1.0 is released
Message-ID: <4415F313-1667-4A20-9005-CB3518BCA43E@cbs.dk>

(Resend with correct Subject field.)

The build system rolled up R-3.1.0.tar.gz (codename "Spring Dance") this morning.

The list below details the changes in this release.

You can get the source code from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.1.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

(There seems to be a minor mishap with the NEWS file not getting copied to CRAN. I'll attend to that shortly.)

CHANGES IN R 3.1.0:

 NEW FEATURES:

   * type.convert() (and hence by default read.table()) returns a
     character vector or factor when representing a numeric input as a
     double would lose accuracy.  Similarly for complex inputs.

     If a file contains numeric data with unrepresentable numbers of
     decimal places that are intended to be read as numeric, specify
     colClasses in read.table() to be "numeric".

   * tools::Rdiff(useDiff = FALSE) is closer to the POSIX definition
     of diff -b (as distinct from the description in the man pages of
     most systems).

   * New function anyNA(), a version of any(is.na(.)) which is fast
     for atomic vectors, based on a proposal by Tim Hesterberg. (Wish
     of PR#15239.)

   * arrayInd(*, useNames = TRUE) and, analogously, which(*, arr.ind =
     TRUE) now make use of names(.dimnames) when available.

   * is.unsorted() now also works for raw vectors.

   * The "table" method for as.data.frame() (also useful as
     as.data.frame.table()) now passes sep and base arguments to
     provideDimnames().

   * uniroot() gets new optional arguments, notably extendInt,
     allowing to auto-extend the search interval when needed.  The
     return value has an extra component, init.it.

   * switch(f, ...) now warns when f is a factor, as this typically
     happens accidentally where the useR meant to pass a character
     string, but f is treated as integer (as always documented).

   * The parser has been modified to use less memory.

   * The way the unary operators (+ - !) handle attributes is now more
     consistent.  If there is no coercion, all attributes (including
     class) are copied from the input to the result: otherwise only
     names, dims and dimnames are.

   * colorRamp() and colorRampPalette() now allow non-opaque colours
     and a ramp in opacity via the new argument alpha = TRUE.
     (Suggested by Alberto Krone-Martins, but optionally as there are
     existing uses which expect only RGB values.)

   * grid.show.layout() and grid.show.viewport() get an optional vp.ex
     argument.

   * There is a new function find_gs_cmd() in the tools package to
     locate a GhostScript executable.  (This is an enhanced version of
     a previously internal function there.)

   * object.size() gains a format() method.

   * There is a new family, "ArialMT", for the pdf() and postscript()
     devices.  This will only be rendered correctly on viewers which
     have access to Monotype TrueType fonts (which are sometimes
     requested by journals).

   * The text and PDF news files, including NEWS and NEWS.2, have been
     moved to the doc directory.

   * combn(x, simplify = TRUE) now gives a factor result for factor
     input x (previously user error).  (Related to PR#15442.)

   * Added utils::fileSnapshot() and utils::changedFiles() functions
     to allow snapshots and comparison of directories of files.

   * make.names(names, unique=TRUE) now tries to preserve existing
     names. (Suggestion of PR#15452.)

   * New functions cospi(x), sinpi(x), and tanpi(x), for more accurate
     computation of cos(pi*x), etc, both in R and the C API.  Using
     these gains accuracy in some cases, e.g., inside lgamma() or
     besselI().  (Suggested by Morten Welinder in PR#15529.)

   * print.table(x, zero.print = ".") now also has an effect when x is
     not integer-valued.

   * There is more support to explore the system's idea of time-zone
     names.  Sys.timezone() tries to give the current system setting
     by name (and succeeds at least on Linux, OS X, Solaris and
     Windows), and OlsonNames() lists the names in the system's Olson
     database. Sys.timezone(location = FALSE) gives the previous
     behaviour.

   * Platforms with a 64-bit time_t type are allowed to handle
     conversions between the "POSIXct" and "POSIXlt" classes for
     date-times outside the 32-bit range (before 1902 or after 2037):
     the existing workarounds are used on other platforms.  (Note that
     time-zone information for post-2037 is speculative at best, and
     the OS services are tested for known errors and so not used on OS
     X.)

     Currently time_t is usually long and hence 64-bit on Unix-alike
     64-bit platforms: however it several cases the time-zone database
     is 32-bit.  On R for Windows it is 64-bit (for both architectures
     as from this version).

   * The "save.defaults" option can include a value for
     compression_level.  (Wish of PR#15579.)

   * colSums() and friends now have support for arrays and data-frame
     columns with 2^31 or more elements.

   * as.factor() is faster when f is an unclassed integer vector (for
     example, when called from tapply()).

   * fft() now works with longer inputs, from the 12 million
     previously supported up to 2 billion.  (PR#15593)

   * Complex svd() now uses LAPACK subroutine ZGESDD, the complex
     analogue of the routine used for the real case.

   * Sweave now outputs .tex files in UTF-8 if the input encoding is
     declared to be UTF-8, regardless of the local encoding.  The
     UTF-8 encoding may now be declared using a LaTeX comment
     containing the string %\SweaveUTF8 on a line by itself.

   * file.copy() gains a copy.date argument.

   * Printing of date-times will make use of the time-zone
     abbreviation in use at the time, if known.  For example, for
     Paris pre-1940 this could be LMT, PMT, WET or WEST.  To enable
     this, the "POSIXlt" class has an optional component "zone"
     recording the abbreviation for each element.

     For platforms which support it, there is also a component
     "gmtoff" recording the offset from GMT where known.

   * (On Windows, by default on OS X and optionally elsewhere.)  The
     system C function strftime has been replaced by a more
     comprehensive version with closer conformance to the POSIX 2008
     standard.

   * dnorm(x, log = FALSE) is more accurate (but somewhat slower) for
     |x| > 5; as suggested in PR#15620.

   * Some versions of the tiff() device have further compression
     options.

   * read.table(), readLines() and scan() have a new argument to
     influence the treatment of embedded nuls.

   * Avoid duplicating the right hand side values in complex
     assignments when possible.  This reduces copying of replacement
     values in expressions such as Z$a <- a0 and ans[[i]] <- tmp: some
     package code has relied on there being copies.

     Also, a number of other changes to reduce copying of objects; all
     contributed by or based on suggestions by Michael Lawrence.

   * The fast argument of KalmanLike(), KalmanRun() and
     KalmanForecast() has been replaced by update, which instead of
     updating mod in place, optionally returns the updated model in an
     attribute "mod" of the return value.

   * arima() and makeARIMA() get a new optional argument SSinit,
     allowing the choice of a different *s*tate *s*pace initialization
     which has been observed to be more reliable close to
     non-stationarity: see PR#14682.

   * warning() has a new argument noBreaks., to simplify
     post-processing of output with options(warn = 1).

   * pushBack() gains an argument encoding, to support reading of
     UTF-8 characters using scan(), read.table() and related functions
     in a non-UTF-8 locale.

   * all.equal.list() gets a new argument use.names which by default
     labels differing components by names (if they match) rather than
     by integer index.  Saved R output in packages may need to be
     updated.

   * The methods for all.equal() and attr.all.equal() now have
     argument check.attributes after ... so it cannot be partially nor
     positionally matched (as it has been, unintentionally).

     A side effect is that some previously undetected errors of
     passing empty arguments (no object between commas) to all.equal()
     are detected and reported.

     There are explicit checks that check.attributes is logical,
     tolerance is numeric and scale is NULL or numeric.  This catches
     some unintended positional matching.

     The message for all.equal.numeric() reports a "scaled difference"
     only for scale != 1.

   * all.equal() now has a "POSIXt" method replacing the "POSIXct"
     method.

   * The "Date" and "POSIXt" methods of seq() allows by = "quarter"
     for completeness (by = "3 months" always worked).

   * file.path() removes any trailing separator on Windows, where they
     are invalid (although sometimes accepted).  This is intended to
     enhance the portability of code written by those using POSIX file
     systems (where a trailing / can be used to confine path matching
     to directories).

   * New function agrepl() which like grepl() returns a logical
     vector.

   * fifo() is now supported on Windows. (PR#15600)

   * sort.list(method = "radix") now allows negative integers (wish of
     PR#15644).

   * Some functionality of print.ts() is now available in
     .preformat.ts() for more modularity.

   * mcparallel() gains an option detach = TRUE which allows execution
     of code independently of the current session.  It is based on a
     new estranged = TRUE argument to mcfork() which forks child
     processes such that they become independent of the parent
     process.

   * The pdf() device omits circles and text at extremely small sizes,
     since some viewers were failing on such files.

   * The rightmost break for the "months", "quarters" and "years"
     cases of hist.POSIXlt() has been increased by a day.  (Inter
     alia, fixes PR#15717.)

   * The handling of DF[i,] <- a where i is of length 0 is improved.
     (Inter alia, fixes PR#15718.)

   * hclust() gains a new method "ward.D2" which implements Ward's
     method correctly.  The previous "ward" method is "ward.D" now,
     with the old name still working.  Thanks to research and
     proposals by Pierre Legendre.

   * The sunspot.month dataset has been amended and updated from the
     official source, whereas the sunspots and sunspot.year datasets
     will remain immutable. The documentation and source links have
     been updated correspondingly.

   * The summary() method for "lm" fits warns if the fit is
     essentially perfect, as most of the summary may be computed
     inaccurately (and with platform-dependent values).

     Programmers who use summary() in order to extract just a
     component which will be reliable (e.g. $cov.unscaled) should wrap
     their calls in suppressWarnings().

 INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

   * The included version of LAPACK has been updated to 3.5.0.

   * There is some support for parallel testing of an installation, by
     setting TEST_MC_CORES to an integer greater than one to indicate
     the maximum number of cores to be used in parallel. (It is worth
     specifying at least 8 cores if available.)  Most of these require
     a make program (such as GNU make and dmake) which supports the
     $MAKE -j nproc syntax.

     Except on Windows: the tests of standard package examples in make
     check are done in parallel.  This also applies to running
     tools::testInstalledPackages().

     The more time-consuming regression tests are done in parallel.

     The package checks in make check-devel and make check-recommended
     are done in parallel.

   * More of make check will work if recommended packages are not
     installed: but recommended packages remain needed for thorough
     checking of an R build.

   * The version of tzcode included in src/extra/tzone has been
     updated.  (Formerly used only on Windows.)

   * The included (64-bit) time-zone conversion code and Olson
     time-zone database can be used instead of the system version: use
     configure option --with-internal-tzcode.  This is the default on
     Windows and OS X.  (Note that this does not currently work if a
     non-default rsharedir configure variable is used.)

     (It might be necessary to set environment variable TZ on OSes
     where this is not already set, although the system timezone is
     deduced correctly on at least Linux, OS X and Windows.)

     This option also switches to the version of strftime included in
     directory src/extra/tzone.

   * configure now tests for a C++11-compliant compiler by testing
     some basic features.  This by default tries flags for the
     compiler specified by CXX, but an alternative compiler, options
     and standard can be specified by variables CXX1X, CXX1XFLAGS and
     CXX1XSTD (e.g. -std=gnu++11).

   * R can now optionally be compiled to use reference counting
     instead of the NAMED mechanism by defining SWITCH_TO_REFCNT in
     Rinternals.h. This may become the default in the future.

   * There is a new option --use-system-tre to use a suitable system
     tre library: at present this means a version from their git
     repository, after corrections.  (Wish of PR#15660.)

 PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

   * The CRANextra repository is no longer a default repository on
     Windows: all the binary versions of packages from CRAN are now on
     CRAN, although CRANextra contains packages from Omegahat and
     elsewhere used by CRAN packages.

   * Only vignettes sources in directory vignettes are considered to
     be vignettes and hence indexed as such.

   * In the DESCRIPTION file,

         License: X11

     is no longer recognized as valid.  Use MIT or BSD_2_clause
     instead, both of which need + file LICENSE.

   * For consistency, entries in .Rinstignore are now matched
     case-insensitively on all platforms.

   * Help for S4 methods with very long signatures now tries harder to
     split the description in the Usage field to no more than 80
     characters per line (some packages had over 120 characters).

   * R CMD INSTALL --build (not Windows) now defaults to the internal
     tar() unless R_INSTALL_TAR is set.

   * There is support for compiling C++11 code in packages on suitable
     platforms: see 'Writing R Extensions'.

   * Fake installs now install the contents of directory inst: some
     packages use this to install e.g. C++ headers for use by other
     packages that are independent of the package itself.  Option
     --no-inst can be used to get the previous behaviour.

 DEBUGGING:

   * The behaviour of the code browser has been made more consistent,
     in part following the suggestions in PR#14985.

   * Calls to browser() are now consistent with calls to the browser
     triggered by debug(), in that Enter will default to n rather than
     c.

   * A new browser command s has been added, to "step into" function
     calls.

   * A new browser command f has been added, to "finish" the current
     loop or function.

   * Within the browser, the command help will display a short list of
     available commands.

 UTILITIES:

   * Only vignettes sources in directory vignettes are considered to
     be vignettes by R CMD check.  That has been the preferred
     location since R 2.14.0 and is now obligatory.

   * For consistency, R CMD build now matches entries in .Rbuildignore
     and vignettes/.install_extras case-insensitively on all platforms
     (not just on Windows).

   * checkFF() (called by R CMD check by default) can optionally check
     foreign function calls for consistency with the registered type
     and argument count.  This is the default for R CMD check
     --as-cran or can be enabled by setting environment variable
     _R_CHECK_FF_CALLS_ to registration (but is in any case suppressed
     by --install=no).  Because this checks calls in which .NAME is an
     R object and not just a literal character string, some other
     problems are detected for such calls.

     Functions suppressForeignCheck() and dontCheck() have been added
     to allow package authors to suppress false positive reports.

   * R CMD check --as-cran warns about a false value of the
     DESCRIPTION field BuildVignettes for Open Source packages, and
     ignores it.  (An Open Source package needs to have complete
     sources for its vignettes which should be usable on a suitably
     well-equipped system).

   * R CMD check --no-rebuild-vignettes is defunct:
     R CMD check --no-build-vignettes has been preferred since R
     3.0.0.

   * R CMD build --no-vignettes is defunct:
     R CMD build --no-build-vignettes has been preferred since R
     3.0.0.

   * R CMD Sweave and R CMD Stangle now process both Sweave and
     non-Sweave vignettes.  The tools::buildVignette() function has
     been added to do the same tasks from within R.

   * The flags returned by R CMD config --ldflags and (where
     installed) pkg-config --libs libR are now those needed to link a
     front-end against the (shared or static) R library.

   * Sweave.sty has a new option [inconsolata].

   * R CMD check customizations such as _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_ make
     available packages only in LinkingTo only for installation, and
     not for loading/runtime tests.

   * tools::checkFF() reports on .C and .Fortran calls with DUP =
     FALSE if argument check_DUP is true.  This is selected by R CMD
     check by default.

   * R CMD check --use-gct can be tuned to garbage-collect less
     frequently using gctorture2() _via_ the setting of environment
     variable _R_CHECK_GCT_N_.

   * Where supported, tools::texi2dvi() limits the number of passes
     tried to 20.

 C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

   * (Windows only) A function R_WaitEvent() has been added (with
     declaration in headerR.h) to block execution until the next event
     is received by R.

   * Remapping in the Rmath.h header can be suppressed by defining
     R_NO_REMAP_RMATH.

   * The remapping of rround() in header Rmath.h has been removed: use
     fround() instead.

   * ftrunc() in header Rmath.h is now a wrapper for the C99 function
     trunc(), which might as well be used in C code: ftrunc() is still
     needed for portable C++ code.

   * The never-documented remapping of prec() to fprec() in header
     Rmath.h has been removed.

   * The included LAPACK subset now contains ZGESDD and ZGELSD.

   * The function LENGTH() now checks that it is only applied to
     vector arguments.  However, in packages length() should be used.
     (In R itself LENGTH() is a macro without the function overhead of
     length().)

   * Calls to SET_VECTOR_ELT() and SET_STRING_ELT() are now checked
     for indices which are in-range: several packages were writing one
     element beyond the allocated length.

   * allocVector3 has been added which allows custom allocators to be
     used for individual vector allocations.

 DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

   * chol(pivot = TRUE, LINPACK = TRUE) is defunct.

     Arguments EISPACK for eigen() and LINPACK for chol(), chol2inv(),
     solve() and svd() are ignored: LAPACK is always used.

   * .find.package() and .path.package() are defunct: only the
     versions without the initial dot introduced in R 2.13.0 have ever
     been in the API.

   * Partial matching when using the $ operator _on data frames_ now
     throws a warning and may become defunct in the future. If partial
     matching is intended, replace foo$bar by foo[["bar", exact =
     FALSE]].

   * The long-deprecated use of \synopsis in the Usage section of .Rd
     files has been removed: such sections are now ignored (with a
     warning).

   * package.skeleton()'s deprecated argument namespace has been
     removed.

   * Many methods are no longer exported by package stats.  They are
     all registered on their generic, which should be called rather
     than calling a method directly.

   * Functions readNEWS() and checkNEWS() in package tools are
     defunct.

   * download.file(method = "lynx") is deprecated.

   * .C(DUP = FALSE) and .Fortran(DUP = FALSE) are now deprecated, and
     may be disabled in future versions of R.  As their help has long
     said, .Call() is much preferred.

     R CMD check notes such usages (by default).

   * The workaround of setting R_OSX_VALGRIND has been removed: it is
     not needed in current valgrind.

 BUG FIXES:

   * Calling lm.wfit() with no non-zero weights gave an array-overrun
     in the Fortran code and a not very sensible answer.  It is now
     special-cased with a simpler answer (no qr component).

   * Error messages involving non-syntactic names (e.g. as produced by
     `\r` when that object does not exist) now encode the control
     characters.  (Reported by Hadley Wickham.)

   * getGraphicsEvent() caused 100% usage of one CPU in Windows.
     (PR#15500)

   * nls() with no start argument may now work inside another function
     (scoping issue).

   * pbeta() and similar work better for very large (billions) ncp.

   * Where time zones have changed abbreviations over the years, the
     software tries to more consistently use the abbreviation
     appropriate to the time or if that is unknown, the current
     abbreviation.  On some platforms where the C function localtime
     changed the tzname variables the reported abbreviation could have
     been that of the last time converted.

   * all.equal(list(1), identity) now works.

   * Bug fix for pushing viewports in grid (reported by JJ Allaire and
     Kevin Ushey).

     NOTE for anyone poking around within the graphics engine display
     list (despite the warnings not to) that this changes what is
     recorded by grid on the graphics engine display list.

   * Extra checks have been added for unit resolution and conversion
     in grid, to catch instances of division-by-zero.  This may
     introduce error messages in existing code and/or produce a
     different result in existing code (but only where a non-finite
     location or dimension may now become zero).

   * Some bugs in TRE have been corrected by updating from the git
     repository.  This allows R to be installed on some platforms for
     which this was a blocker (PR#15087 suggests Linux on ARM and
     HP-UX).

   * ? applied to a call to an S4 generic failed in several cases.
     (PR#15680)
     which this was a blocker (PR#15087 suggests Linux on ARM and
     HP-UX).

   * ? applied to a call to an S4 generic failed in several cases.
     (PR#15680)

   * The implicit S4 generics for primitives with ... in their
     argument list were incorrect. (PR#15690)

   * Bug fixes to methods::callGeneric(). (PR#15691)

   * The bug fix to aggregrate() in PR#15004 introduced a new bug in
     the case of no grouping variables. (PR#15699)

   * In rare cases printing deeply nested lists overran a buffer by
     one byte and on a few platforms segfaulted. (PR#15679)

   * The dendrogram method of as.dendrogram() was hidden accidentally,
     (PR#15703), and order.dendrogram(d) gave too much for a leaf d.
     (PR#15702)

   * R would try to kill processes on exit that have pids ever used by
     a child process spawned by mcparallel even though the current
     process with that pid was not actually its child.

   * cophenetic() applied to a "dendrogram" object sometimes
     incorrectly returned a "Labels" attribute with dimensions.
     (PR#15706)

   * printCoefmat() called from quite a few print() methods now obeys
     small getOption("width") settings, line wrapping the "signif.
     codes" legend appropriately.  (PR#15708)

   * model.matrix() assumed that the stored dimnames for a matrix was
     NULL or length 2, but length 1 occurred.

   * The clipping region for a device was sometimes used in base
     graphics before it was set.

Subject: Updates from the useR! 2014 organizing committee
Message-ID: <CABFfbXsw5X7=Zsw_awy3XWYYtQ1-rc2qC+H9Bws+A0NGcwoMJg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We are exactly one month away from the useR! 2014 conference [1]. Time
for an update from the organizing committee.

This weekend, registrations passed the 500 mark, which is a new record
for useR! according to data collected by Gergely Dar?czi [2]. Yet,
there is plenty of additional capacity, both for the conference
itself, as well as the beautiful on-campus housing at UCLA. We hope to
see many more registrations over the upcoming weeks and appreciate all
help in spreading the word to friends and colleagues that (should) use
R, but might not be actively following the blogs or mailing lists.

To those who are unsure whether to attend, we want to emphasize that
useR! is not just for seasoned professionals, but has lots to offer to
any R user. Abstracts and (free) tutorials cover a great diversity of
topics in both research and industry applications, ranging from
introductory to very advanced. The conference provides a great
opportunity to learn and mingle with the community, and is interesting
for beginner as well as experienced R users.

Tutorials this year are included with the conference ticket and no
separate registration is required. All registrants will receive an
email survey asking which tutorial they would like to attend, if any.
This information will be used for scheduling purposes and to
facilitate communication between presenters and participants (e.g.
distribution of preparation material).

Finally, we urge international guests to verify that their visa or
visa-waiver documents are valid to enter the United States. Citizens
from visa-waiver countries [3] that do not already have a US visa,
must apply online for an ESTA travel authorization at least 72 hours
prior to departure. Once approved, the ESTA is generally valid for a
period of 2 years, so now would be a good time to complete this
process.

We look forward to seeing all of you in California! Please keep an eye
on the conference website, which is continuously updated with most
recent news and information as it becomes available.

Best,

Jeroen, on behalf of the organizing committee

Subject: [R]  R 3.1.1 is released
Message-ID: <737AC669-98EA-41D4-9C83-ABB6F09C6724@cbs.dk>

The build system rolled up R-3.1.1.tar.gz (codename "Sock it to Me") this morning.

The list below details the changes in this release.

You can get the source code from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.1.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course. Perhaps with some delays due to vacations. In particular, the Mac OS X maintainer is traveling and may be without Internet access for some days yet.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * When attach() reports conflicts, it does so compatibly with
      library() by using message().

    * R CMD Sweave no longer cleans any files by default, compatibly
      with versions of R prior to 3.1.0.  There are new options
      --clean, --clean=default and --clean=keepOuts.

    * tools::buildVignette() and tools::buildVignettes() with clean =
      FALSE no longer remove any created files.  buildvignette() gains
      a keep argument for more cleaning customization.

    * The Bioconductor 'version' used by setRepositories() can now be
      set by environment variable R_BIOC_VERSION at runtime, not just
      when R is installed.  (It has been stated that Bioconductor will
      switch from 'version' 2.14 to 'version' 3.0 during the lifetime
      of the R 3.1 series.)

    * Error messages from bugs in embedded Sexpr code in Sweave
      documents now report the source location.

    * type.convert(), read.table() and similar read.*() functions get a
      new numerals argument, specifying how numeric input is converted
      when its conversion to double precision loses accuracy.  The
      default value, "allow.loss" allows accuracy loss, as in R
      versions before 3.1.0.

    * For some compilers, integer addition could overflow without a
      warning.  R's internal code for both integer addition and
      subtraction is more robust now.  (PR#15774)

    * The function determining the default number of knots for
      smooth.spline() is now exported, as .nknots.smspl().

    * dbeta(, a,b), pbeta(), qbeta() and rbeta() are now defined also
      for a = 0, b = 0, or infinite a and b (where they typically
      returned NaN before).

    * Many package authors report that the RStudio graphics device does
      not work correctly with their package's use of dev.new().  The
      new option dev.new(noRStudioGD = TRUE) replaces the RStudio
      override by the default device as selected by R itself, still
      respecting environment variables R_INTERACTIVE_DEVICE and
      R_DEFAULT_DEVICE.

    * readRDS() now returns visibly.

    * Modifying internal logical scalar constants now results in an
      error instead of a warning.

    * install.packages(repos = NULL) now accepts http:// or ftp:// URLs
      of package archives as well as file paths, and will download as
      required.  In most cases repos = NULL can be deduced from the
      extension of the URL.

    * The warning when using partial matching with the $ operator on
      data frames is now only given when
      options("warnPartialMatchDollar") is TRUE.

    * Package help requests like package?foo now try the package foo
      whether loaded or not.

    * General help requests now default to trying all loaded packages,
      not just those on the search path.

    * Added a new function promptImport(), to generate a help page for
      a function that was imported from another package (and presumably
      re-exported, or help would not be needed).

  INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

    * configure option --with-internal-tzcode can now be used with
      variable rsharedir.

    * The included version of PCRE has been updated to 8.35.

    * There is a new target make uninstall-libR to remove an installed
      shared/static libR.

      make install-libR now works if a sub-architecture is used,
      although the user will need to specify libdir differently for
      different sub-architectures.

    * There is more extensive advice on which LaTeX packages are
      required to install R or to make package manuals (as done by R
      CMD check) in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.

    * Compilers/linkers were handling the visibility controls in
      src/extra/xz inconsistently (and apparently in some cases
      incorrectly), so it has been simplified.  (PR#15327)

    * (Windows) There is updated support for the use of ICU for
      collation: see the 'R Installation and Administration Manual'.

  BUG FIXES:

    * dbinom(x, n), pbinom(), dpois(), etc, are slightly less
      restrictive in checking if n is integer-valued.  (Wish of
      PR#15734.)

    * pchisq(x, df, ncp, log.p = TRUE) is more accurate and no longer
      underflows for small x and ncp < 80, e.g, for pchisq(1e-5, df =
      100, ncp = 1, log = TRUE).  (Based on PR#15635 and a suggestion
      by Roby Joehanes.)

    * The s ("step into") command in the debugger would cause R to step
      into expressions evaluated there, not just into functions being
      debugged.  (PR#15770)

    * The C code used by strptime() rejected time-zone offsets of more
      than +1200 (+1245, +1300 and +1400 can occur).  (PR#15768)

    * (Windows only.)  png(type = "cairo", antialias = "gray") was not
      accepted.  (PR#15760)

    * Use of save(..., envir=) with named objects could fail.
      (PR#15758)

    * Sweave() mis-parsed Sexpr expressions that contained backslashes.
      (PR#15779)

    * The return value from options(foo = NULL) was not the previous
      value of the option.  (PR#15781)

    * enc2utf8() and enc2native() did not always mark the encoding of
      the return values when it was known.

    * dnbinom(x, size = <large>, mu, log = TRUE) no longer underflows
      to -Inf for large mu, thanks to a suggestion from Alessandro
      Mammana (MPI MolGen, Berlin).

    * pbeta(x, a, b, log = TRUE) no longer behaves discontinuously (in
      a small x-region) because of denormalized numbers.  Also,
      pbeta(1-1e-12, 1e30, 1.001, log=TRUE) now terminates "in real
      time".

    * The "CRAN" filter (see available.packages()) no longer removes
      duplicates other than of packages on CRAN, and does not fail if
      there is no CRAN repository in getOption("repos").

    * The device listing from dev2bitmap() and bitmap() was truncated
      to 1000 characters: modern versions of GhostScript on most
      platforms have many more devices.

    * (Windows.)  Commands such as Sys.which() and pipe() which needed
      to find the full path to a command could segfault if the 'long'
      path name was much longer than the 'short' path name (which
      Sys.which() returns), as the behaviour of the Windows API call
      had changed.

    * R CMD build will fail with an error if one of the packages
      specified in the VignetteBuilder field is not installed.
      (Without loading those packages it cannot be ascertained which
      files are intended to be vignettes. This means that the
      VignetteBuilder packages have to be installed for package
      checking too.)  (Wish of PR#15775.)

    * Misguided attempts to use chull() with non-finite points now give
      an error (related to PR#15777).

    * For a formula with exactly 32 variables the 32nd variable was
      aliased to the intercept in some C-level computations of terms,
      so that for example attempting to remove it would remove the
      intercept instead (and leave a corrupt internal structure).
      (PR#15735)

    * anyDuplicated() silently returned wrong values when the first
      duplicate was at an index which was too large to be stored in an
      integer vector (although a lot of RAM and patience would have
      been needed to encounter this).

    * tools::Rd2ex(commentDontrun = FALSE) failed if the block had only
      one line.

    * Hexadecimal constants such as 0x110p-5L which were incorrectly
      qualified by L were parsed incorrectly since R 3.0.0, with a
      slightly garbled warning. (PR#15753)

    * system() returned success on some platforms even if the system
      was unable to launch a process. (PR#15796)

    * (Windows Rgui console.)  Unbuffered output was sometimes not
      output immediately if the prompt was not on the last line of the
      console.

    * The built-in help server did not declare the encoding for the
      DESCRIPTION or other text files to be the package encoding, so
      non-ASCII characters could be displayed incorrectly.

    * R is now trying harder to not cleanup child processes that were
      not spawned by mcparallel() on platforms that provide information
      about the source process of the SIGCHLD signal. This allows 3rd
      party libraries to manage the exit status of children that they
      spawn without R interfering.

    * mcmapply() was only parallelizing if the number of jobs was
      bigger than the number of cores. It now parallelizes if the
      number of jobs is more than one.

    * Auto-printing would re-evaluate its argument when trying to
      dispatch to a print method.  This is now avoided when possible.

    * Unserializing (including load() and readRDS()) could silently
      return incorrect numeric values from ASCII saves if there was a
      read error.

    * getParseData() could return incorrect values for the parents of
      some elements. (Reported by Andrew Redd.)

    * Attempting to use data frames of 2^31 or more rows with merge()
      or to create a merged data frame of that size now gives a clearer
      error message.

    * parse() did not check its file argument was a connection if it
      was not a character string, so e.g. parse(FALSE) attempted to
      read from stdin.

      Nor did dump() and dput().

    * The "help.try.all.packages" option was ignored when the shortcut
      syntax for help was used, e.g. ?foo.

    * A potential segfault in string allocation has been fixed.  (Found
      by Radford Neal.)

    * Potential memory protection errors in sort() and D() have been
      fixed. (Found by Radford Neal.)

    * Fixed a lack of error checking in graphics event functions.
      (Found by Radford Neal; a different patch used here than the one
      in pqR.)

    * numericDeriv() sometimes miscalculated the gradient.  (PR#15849,
      reported originally by Radford Neal)

From pd.mes at cbs.dk  Fri Oct 31 11:13:24 2014
From: pd.mes at cbs.dk (Peter Dalgaard)
Date: Fri, 31 Oct 2014 11:13:24 +0100
Subject: [R]  R 3.1.2 is released
Message-ID: <97264A18-3A52-4B9B-B97F-A78923BE6818@cbs.dk>

The build system rolled up R-3.1.2.tar.gz (codename "Pumpkin Helmet") this morning.

The list below details the changes in this release.

You can get the source code from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.1.2.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course. 

For the R Core Team

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file


CHANGES IN R 3.1.2:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * embedFonts() now defaults to format = "ps2write" for .ps and .eps
      files.  This is available in Ghostscript 9.x (since 2010) whereas
      the previous default, format = "pswrite", was removed in
      Ghostscript 9.10.

    * For consistency with [dpqr]norm(), [dp]lnorm(sdlog = 0) model a
      point mass at exp(mulog) rather than return NaN (for an error).

    * capabilities() now reports if ICU is compiled in for use for
      collation (it is only actually used if a suitable locale is set
      for collation, and never for a C locale).

    * (OS X only.) Package tcltk checks when loaded if it is linked
      against the CRAN X11-based Tcl/Tk and if so that the Tcl/Tk
      component and the X11 libraries are installed.  This allows more
      informative error messages to be given advising the installation
      of the missing component or of XQuartz.

      The X11() device and X11-based versions of the data editor and
      viewer (invoked by edit() and View() for data frames and matrices
      from command-line R) check that the X11 libraries are installed
      and if not advises installing XQuartz.

    * icuSetCollate() allows locale = "default", and locale = "none" to
      use OS services rather than ICU for collation.

      Environment variable R_ICU_LOCALE can be used to set the default
      ICU locale, in case the one derived from the OS locale is
      inappropriate (this is currently necessary on Windows).

    * New function icuGetCollate() to report on the ICU collation
      locale in use (if any).

    * utils::URLencode() was updated to use unreserved and reserved
      characters from RFC 3986, <URL:
      http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>, instead of RFC 1738.

    * unique(warnings()) and c(warnings()) are now supported.

    * The Bioconductor 'version' used by setRepositories() now defaults
      to 3.0. (It can be set at runtime _via_ environment variable
      R_BIOC_VERSION.)

  INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

    * The configure script reports on the more important
      capabilities/options which will not be compiled in.

      More types of external BLAS are recognized by name in that
      report.

    * When building R as a shared library, the -L${R_HOME}/lib${R_ARCH}
      flag is placed earlier in the link commands used during
      installation and when packages are installed: this helps ensure
      that the current build has priority if an R shared library has
      already been installed by e.g. install-libR in a library
      mentioned in LDFLAGS (and not in 'your system's library
      directory' as documented). (Wish of PR#15790.)

    * LaTeX package upquote is no longer required for R's use of
      inconsolata.

    * (Windows only) If both 32 and 64 bit versions of R are installed,
      the bin/R.exe and bin/Rscript.exe executables now run 64 bit R.
      (To run 32 bit R, overwrite these files with copies of
      bin/i386/Rfe.exe.)

  UTILITIES:

    * Running R CMD check with _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_ true now makes
      the VignetteBuilder packages available even if they are listed in
      Suggests, since they are needed to recognise and process
      non-Sweave vignettes.

    * R CMD check now reports empty importFrom declarations in a
      NAMESPACE file, as these are common errors (writing
      importFrom(Pkg) where import(Pkg) was intended).

    * R CMD check now by default checks code usage directly on the
      package namespace without loading and attaching the package and
      its suggests and enhances.  For good practice with packages in
      the Suggests field, see SS1.1.3.1 of 'Writing R Extensions'.  For
      use of lazy-data objects in the package's own code, see ?data.

  BUG FIXES:

    * dmultinom() did not handle non-finite probabilities correctly.

    * prettyNum(x, zero.print=*) now also works when x contains NAs.

    * A longstanding bug exhibited by nlminb() on Windows was traced to
      a compiler bug in gcc 4.6.3; a workaround has been put in place.
      (PR#15244 and PR#15914).

    * Rendering of \command in HTML versions of help pages has been
      improved: this is particularly evident on the help page for
      INSTALL.

    * as.hexmode(x) and as.octmode(x) now behave correctly for some
      numeric x, e.g., c(NA, 1) or c(1, pi).

    * drop1() failed if the scope argument had no variables to drop.
      (PR#15935)

    * edit() (and hence fix()) failed if an object had a non-character
      attribute named "source" (an attribute that had been used in R
      prior to version 2.14.0).

    * callGeneric() could fail if the generic had ... as a formal
      argument. (PR#15937).

    * Forking in package parallel called C entry point exit in the
      child.  This was unsafe (_exit should have been called), and
      could flush stdin of the main R process (seen most often on
      Solaris).

      As good practice, stdout is now flushed before forking a child.

    * R objects such as list(`a\b` = 1) now print correctly.

    * getAnywhere("C_pbinom") now returns correctly a single object
      (rather than unlisting it).

    * The confint() method for nls() fits failed it these has specified
      parameter limits despite using an algorithm other than "port".
      (PR#15960)

    * Subclassing an S4 class failed if the class required arguments to
      the generator, through its initialize() method.

    * removeSource() did not properly handle expressions containing
      arguments that were supplied as missing, e.g.  x[i,]. (PR#15957)

    * as.environment(list()) now works, and as.list() of such an
      environment is now the same as list().

    * Several tcltk functions failed when run in unusual environments.
      (PR#15970)

    * options(list()) now works (trivially). (PR#15979)

    * merge(<dendrogram>, ..) now works correctly for two `independent'
      dendrograms (PR#15648), and still compatibly via adjust = "auto"
      e.g. for two branches of an existing dendrogram.

    * The plot method for "hclust" objects gets an optional argument
      check; When that is true (the default) it checks more carefully
      for valid input.

    * (Windows only) If a user chose to install 64 bit R but not 32 bit
      R, the bin/R and bin/Rscript executables failed to run.
      (PR#15981)

    * Various possible buffer overruns have been prevented, and missed
      memory protection added. (PR#15990)

    * Rscript no longer passes --args to R when there are no extra
      ("user") arguments.

    * objects like getClass("refClass")@prototype now print() and str()
      without error.

    * identical() now also looks at the S4 bit.

    * hist(x, breaks) is more robust in adding a small fuzz to few
      breaks when some are very large. (PR#15988)

    * sub() and gsub() did not handle regular expressions like "\s{2,}"
      properly if the text contained NA or non-ascii elements in a
      UTF-8 locale.  Part of this was due to a bug in the TRE library.
      (PR#16009)

    * RShowDoc("NEWS") now displays the PDF version.

    * Matrices and arrays with last dimension zero did not print at all
      or incompletely.  (PR#16012)

    * plot.histogram() and hence hist() now respect the xaxs, yaxs and
      lab graphics parameters.  (PR#16021)

    * bw.SJ(x) and other bw.*() no longer segfault when x contains
      non-finite values. (PR#16024)

    * R CMD Rd2pdf unintentionally ignored its --os option.

    * The internal method of download.file() was not reporting file
      sizes and progress correctly on files larger than 2GB (inherited
      from libxml2).  This is corrected for 64-bit builds (32-bit
      platforms may not support such files, but where possible will be
      supported in future versions of R).

    * Work around a bug in OS X Yosemite where key environment
      variables may be duplicated causing issues in subprocesses. The
      duplicates are now removed on R startup (via Rprofile).
      (PR#16042)

    * Adjust X11 auto-launch detection in DISPLAY on OS X to recognize
      latest XQuartz.

From maechler at stat.math.ethz.ch  Tue Dec 16 15:26:30 2014
From: maechler at stat.math.ethz.ch (Martin Maechler)
Date: Tue, 16 Dec 2014 15:26:30 +0100
Subject: The R Foundation - New board 
Message-ID: <21648.16662.859007.156817@stat.math.ethz.ch>

Dear R lovers and other useRs,
notably benefactors, donors, supporting members and institutions
of the R foundation 
       http://www.r-project.org/foundation/

About 11.7 years ago, in April 2003, the R Foundation was
announced by Fritz Leisch, 
  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2003/000385.html
shortly after its foundation, and since then, its board has
lead the foundation during years of phenomenal growth and success.

Our thanks go to the *past* board members

   Presidents:	      	 Robert Gentleman, Ross Ihaka 
   Secretary General:    Friedrich Leisch 
   Treasurer:	      	 Kurt Hornik 
   Member at Large:      John Chambers 

In addition, Peter Dalgaard and Martin M?chler had acted as auditors.

After Summer meetings of the R Core and the R Foundation,
we, i.e., Robert Gentleman, on Sep. 15 announced
the new ("ordinary") memberships and the fact that the
membership of the foundation has grown to 29 persons:
    https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2014/000577.html

Subsequently (after a careful nomination and voting process),
the election of a new *board* finalized on December 1, and the
new board has started acting since.
It consists of

Presidents:        Duncan Murdoch, Martyn Plummer 
Secretary General: Martin M?chler 
Treasurer:         Kurt Hornik 
Members at Large:  John Chambers 
                   Brian Ripley
                   Dirk Eddelbuettel 

and the two auditors Peter Dalgaard and Roger Bivand.
This is very soon to be reflected on
    http://www.r-project.org/foundation/board.html


The foundation and its board aim to become considerably more
active in the future.  Details about this will be announced here
in due time. 

Thank you all for supporting the R project, a Free Software
(hence Open source) endeavor only made possible by the dedicated
work of many thousands of volunteers and their contributions in several ways, 
including to become supporting (or ++) members of the R foundation!

Martin Maechler
