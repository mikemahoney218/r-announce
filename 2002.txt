Subject: New package: colSums
Message-ID: <15417.55256.783769.400491@gargle.gargle.HOWL>


I've uploaded a package colSums_1.0.tar.gz to CRAN /src/contrib/Devel.  It
contains functions colSums, colMeans, colVars, colStdevs, rowSums, rowMeans,
rowVars, and rowStdevs.  These do simple, fast arithmetic on columns/rows of a
matrix, or more generally across dimensions of an array, e.g. colSums(m) =
apply(m, 2, sum) but faster.  They should be compatible with the corresponding
S-Plus functions.

The core code was written by Doug Bates <bates at stat.wisc.edu>, as package
"MatUtils", and posted to R-help on July 19, 2001.  Many thanks to Doug, Peter
Dalgaard <p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk>, Thomas Lumley <tlumley at u.washington.edu>,
and Prof Brian Ripley <ripley at stats.ox.ac.uk> for their assistance; see the
R-help thread "colSums in C".

- Brian Ripley has taken up the torch to improve these functions further and
  put them in R-devel, hopefully (I think) for R-1.5.0.  That's why my package
  is in /src/contrib/Devel; it should be obsolete by the next release of R!  I
  expect complete argument compatibility, though, since we have both tried to
  be compatible with S-Plus.

- I detect NA's with a trick that Thomas Lumley suggested (it's not NA or NaN
  if x==x), which works really great for me, but may not be portable.  If it
  doesn't work for you, try modifying the #define line in colSums.c.  I would
  like to hear about platforms where this fails.

- colVars is very naive, e.g. I'm probably exacerbating roundoff error when
  mu >> sigma.  I personally don't worry because in finance, mu (return) is
  never >> sigma (risk) :-).  The S-Plus documentation for colVars claims they
  do something fancy with the "two-pass method described in Chan, Golub, and
  LeVeque (1983)" that I don't know anything about.

- I convert integers, logicals, and complex immediately to reals, which is
  probably inefficient.  Brian Ripley's version seems to do a better job.

- S-Plus does not have "rowStdevs" for reasons unknown, since it is simply
  defined as rowStdevs(x, ...) <- function(x, ...) sqrt(rowVars(x, ...)).

- For me, colSums is about 23x faster than apply (on a 400 x 40000 matrix).

Dear R-announce list members,

I've just uploaded to CRAN a substantially revised version (0.6-0) of the 
sem (structural-equations model) package. The new version uses a formula 
for the gradient to fit generalized SEMs, and also allows symbolic 
specification of the model.

As always, comments and suggestions are appreciated.

Subject: New version 6.3-1 of VR bundle
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0201100823150.7222-100000@gannet.stats>


A new version, 6.3-1, of the VR bundle is now on CRAN and
update.packages() should get it for you on Unix and Windows.  The change
in minor version number reflects a number of additions which are to
support the 4th edition of `Modern Applied Statistics in S' (due in about
August, and covering R as well as S-PLUS).  (The scripts are still for
MASS3; version 7.0 will have the scripts for MASS4.)

Some of the recent changes:

MASS:

- new function fitdistr for ML estimation of univariate distributions.
- new function glmmPQL to use lme to fit GLMMs by PQL.
- truehist allows rule for nbins to be specified as a character string.
- parcoord function.
- new datasets bacteria, epil, nlschools, SP500

class:

- batchSOM and ancilliary functions.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0201142100470.22392-100000@gstat205.stat.wisc.edu>




A new version of the Lattice package is now available on CRAN. A list of
the (mostly minor) changes are given below. The documentation is probably
still a bit shaky at places, and suggestions for improvement would be
appreciated.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in lattice 0.4
======================

Some of the implementation details have changed a lot (mainly in
print.trellis). This might cause some old code to fail, though no such
instances are known.

No significant new features have been added, but there are several
bugfixes (notably in levelplot). The important changes are:

 o documentation restructured. There is no topic called `trellis.args'
   any more. The detailed description of the arguments common to all
   high level trellis functions can be found under help(xyplot)

 o once trellis.device() is called, Lattice graphics and base R
   graphics should mix more or less seamlessly. There is an optional
   argument in trellis.device() that can deal with the first blank
   page problem, with certain restrictions.

 o a (as yet very small) demo, called by demo("lattice")

 o Clipping: whatever is drawn by the panel function is now clipped to
   inside the panel region. Strip texts are clipped to inside the
   strips.

 o Axis tick labels by default do not overlap, some tick marks are
   left unlabelled if necessary.

 o The argument list for strip.default changed to be like S

 o levels() and nlevels() give sensible answers for shingles. new
   print methods for shingles and levels of shingles

 o colorkey (currently used only in levelplot) can now be placed to
   the left, top or bottom as well

 o new ``lines'' component in the par.strip.text argument that can be
   used to change the height of strips 

 o xlab, main etc can be double height strings (containing "\n"-s),
   the spaces allocated for these would be automatically adjusted

 o strip.default now has style=5

 o new panel.superpose.2 (suggested by Neil Klepeis)

 o the default colour settings sometimes seem too light on a white
   background. To deal with this, there is a new setting with some
   darker colours that can be set by calling lset(theme =
   "white.bg"). see ?lset for details. This is currently in a
   proof-of-concept stage (the colors in "white.bg" were chosen just
   because I liked their names) and suggestions for better color
   schemes would be most welcome.

 o show.settings() added

[apologies if this message has appeared previously]


Dear R community

A few weeks ago, I uploaded a small text file called R-and-octave.txt
to the contributed docs section of CRAN.  This file details
octave/matlab commands and their (near) equivalents in R (Matlab is a
widely-used high-level graphics/mathematics tool and octave a free
clone).

Someone has just pointed out to me that I never announced its
existence to anyone, hence this email (I understand that some people
don't check CRAN every single day with baited breath looking for new R
stuff ;-).

JSS, which is at http://www.jstatsoft.org, publishes statistical software
with manuals, as well as papers describing, comparing, and evaluating 
statistical
software. Abstracts of all contributions accepted in JSS are published in
printed form in JCGS.

Although we publish software written in any language, we especially
welcome software written in R. The general idea is that packages written
in R can be documented in both "R News" and in JSS, but that generally 
the
description in JSS will be more extensive and more seriously 
peer-reviewed.
Everybody in the R community is encouraged to submit their R products
to JSS, we even welcome "code snippet" type of contributions (which will
go into a separate section of the journal).

Volume 7, 2002, consists so far of the following three issues

issue 1:
S. Weisberg
Dimension reduction regression in R.

issue 2:
A. Zeileis, F. Leisch, and K. Hornik
strucchange: an R package for testing for structural change
in linear regression models

issue 3:
G. Marsaglia and W.W. Tsang
Some difficult-to-pass tests of randomness.

Subject: R version 1.4.1 is released
Message-ID: <x2wuy0q963.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've rolled up R-1.4.1.tgz a short while ago. This is a patch upgrade,
fixing the most important bugs that cropped up after the 1.4.0 release.

A set of recommended packages which have been tested with R-1.4.1 has
been bundled up. Binary distributions are expected to include these
packages.

You can get the files from the developer site

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.1.tgz
ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.1-recommended.tgz

or

http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.4.1.tgz
http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.4.1-recommended.tgz

or wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. This may not
happen right away due to circumstances in Vienna. Binaries for various
platforms will appear in due course.

There are also versions split for floppies and a patch file against 1.4.0.


        For the R Core Team,

        Peter D.


Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.4.1


BUG FIXES

    o	scan(multi.line = FALSE) now always gives an immediate error
	message if a line is incomplete. (As requested in PR#1210)

    o	read.table() is no longer very slow in processing comments:
	moved to C code and fewer lines checked.

    o	type.convert() could give stack imbalance warnings if used
	with as.is = TRUE.

    o	predict.mlm ignored newdata (PR#1226) and also offsets.

    o	demo(tkttest) was inadvertently changed in 1.4.0 so that it would
	evaluate the requested test, but not display the result.

    o	stars(scale = TRUE) (the default) now works as documented (and
	as S does).  Previously it only scaled the maximum to 1. (PR#1230)

    o	d0 <- data.frame(a = 0); data.matrix(d0[0, 0]) and
	data.matrix(d0[, 0]) now work.

    o	plot(multiple time series, plot.type = "single") was computing
	`ylim' from the first series only.

    o	plot.acf() has a new `xpd = par("xpd")' argument which by default
	*does* clipping (of the horizontal lines) as desired (xpd = NA was
	used before, erronously in most cases).

    o	predict(smooth.spline(.), deriv = 1) now works.

    o	identify() failed when x is a structure/matrix. (PR#1238)

    o	getMethod() returns NULL when optional=TRUE as promised in the
	documentation.

    o	setMethod() allows "..." to be one of the arguments omitted in
	the method definition (but so far no check for ... being missing)

    o	Allow round() to work again on very large numbers (introduced
	in fixing PR#1138). (PR#1254)

    o	Rinternals.h is now accepted by a C++ compiler.

    o	type.convert() was failing to detect integer overflow.

    o	piechart() was defaulting to foreground colour (black) fills
	rather than background (as used in 1.3.1 and earlier).	Now
	background is used, but be aware that as from 1.4.0 this may
	be transparent.

    o	La.eigen(*, only.values=TRUE) does not segfault anymore in one
	branch (PR#1262).

    o	cut() now produces correct default labels even when
	include.lowest = TRUE (PR#1263).

    o	reformulate() works properly with a response.

    o	cmdscale(*, k = 1) now works properly.

    o	Options by = "month" and "year" to seq.POSIXt() will always
	take account of changes to/from daylight savings time: this
	was not working on some platforms.

    o	glm.fit.null() now accepts all the arguments of glm.fit() (it
	could be called from glm.fit with arguments it did not
	accept), and is now documented.

    o	cov.wt(cbind(1), cor = TRUE) now works.

    o	predict(glm.object, se.fit = TRUE) was failing if the fit
	involved an offset.

    o	detach() on package:base would crash R. (PR#1271)

    o	print or summary on a manova() object with no terms, no names on
	the response and intercept = FALSE (which is not sensible)
	would give an error.

    o	seek() on file connections was ignoring the `origin' argument.

    o	Fixed new environment handling in library() to avoid forcing
	promises created by delay()

    o	arima0() could leak memory: now released via on.exit().

    o	qr.coef(qr,*) now keeps the names of qr$qr.

    o	read.00Index() no longer fails on data indexes not generated by
	Rdindex (PR#1274).

Windows binaries for 1.4.1 are available at

http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin

and will mirror across CRAN over the next couple of days.

SetupR.exe in this release contains the grid and lattice packages.

These have been built on the same system as the second release of rw1040
and R-patched so I do not anticipate any problems but have only been able
to test them on Windows 2000.

This is a patch release, and the only Windows-specific change is to use
try() when updating HTML indices, e.g. from help.start() which also has a
new `update' argument to turn off updating if required.

One further note about R1.4.1 changes

There have been a number of requests for support for SPSS value labels in
read.spss. The version in the `foreign' package in R 1.4.1-recommended now
turns variables with value labels into R factors (by default). We still
don't support labels on just a few values of a continuous variable.

Debian packages of R-1.4.1 and R-1.4.1-recommended [1] have been uploaded for
i386 and are currently available at http://incoming.debian.org.  These will
run on any current "testing" (aka "woody") or "unstable" (aka "sid")
distribution. 

The next archive installation (around 14:00h Central time tomorrow) will move
these files into the package pool from where they will propagate to the usual
mirror sites.

The build daemons for the non-i386 architectures will then complement the
i386 release. We currently have 1.4.0 packages for alpha, arm, hppa, i386,
ia64, m68k, powerpc, s390 and sparc. We will look into the currently missing
architectures (mips, mipsel) but these might have compiler problems which
prevent the build process from completing.

If someone can and wants to build 1.4.1 on Debian "stable" (aka "potato") for
the i386 platform, please let me know by email. We would need to alter the
debian/* files slightly but this could easily be arranged for.

Dirk's Debian packages are now installed on the cran.us.r-project.org
site and will be mirrored tonight to the main CRAN site.  If you are
running Debian GNU/Linux and have lines like

deb-src http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian woody main
deb http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian woody main

in your /etc/apt/sources.list file, you should be able to install
these packages with
 apt-get update
 apt-get install r-base r-recommended r-doc-pdf
or upgrade your current R packages with
 apt-get update
 apt-get upgrade

Subject: New package pastecs
Message-ID: <MABBLJDICACNFOLGIHJOGEFHCJAA.phgrosje@ulb.ac.be>


Hi all,

There is a new package in CRAN:

PASTECS (package for analysis of space-time ecological series).

Although primarily intended for ecologists, it should be useful to analyze
any kind of time-series. It provides several methods that are complementary
to other existing time-series libraries in CRAN. It's strength is in
regulation and decomposition of series. Some methods are quite original,
like the turnogram, Auto/CrossD2 and D2 to the center, the area method, the
distogram,...

It runs on R (Unix/Linux, Windows and Macintosh) and also on Splus.

Beside it's availability on CRAN, there are also various versions
(Splus,...) available from the web site http://www.sciviews.org/pastecs...
and shortly a 250+ pages user manual in French but that is planned to be
translated in English shortly.

Best,

Philippe Grosjean

We have just published the fourth issue of R News on

        http://cran.R-project.org/doc/Rnews

where you can download the newsletter as PDF or postscript file. It
will propagate to the CRAN mirrors within a day or two.

This is the first special issue of R News, with an emphasis on
applying R in medical statistics.  It is special in many ways: first,
it took longer to prepare than we had originally antipicated (which
typically seems to happen for special issues).  Second, the newsletter
file is rather large as there are many exciting images---in fact, in
trying to keep the size reasonable, in some cases images are only
included at a lower resolution, with the ``real stuff'' available from
the respective authors' web pages.  And finally, articles are fewer
but longer: as many of the applications described are based on recent
advances in medical technology, we felt that extra space with
background information was warranted.

Contents:

Reading foreign files
Maximally selected rank statistics in R.
Quality control and early diagnostics for cDNA microarrays.
Bioconductor.
AnalyzeFMRI: An R package for the exploration and analysis of MRI and
  fMRI datasets. 
Using R for the analysis of DNA microarray data.

Hello,

 I have uploaded a new release of the package RArcInfo. It allows the
user to import Arc/Info V7.x binary coverages into R and to plot maps
with them.

At CRAN, you can find the source code together with a precompiled package
for Windows.

The news in this release are:

* V 0.2
- Added a new function to plot polygons (plotpoly).
- get.tabledata labels the columns using get.tablefields.
- Added a function to import TXT data (get_txt_data).
- Fixed a bug in the documentation. "infodir" has been changed to
"datadir" in most functions.
- Added a new manual page about the whole package. Try 'help(RArcInfo)'.


Enjoy!,

 Virgilio

Subject: random forests for R
Message-ID: <51F9C42DA15CD311BD220008C707D81906FFC18C@usrymx10.merck.com>


Hi all,

There is now a package available on CRAN that provides an R interface to Leo
Breiman's random forest classifier.

Basically, random forest does the following:

1.  Select ntree, the number of trees to grow, and mtry, a number no larger
than number of variables.
2.  For i = 1 to ntree:
3.  Draw a bootstrap sample from the data.  Call those not in the bootstrap
sample the "out-of-bag" data.
4.  Grow a "random" tree, where at each node, the best split is chosen among
mtry randomly selected variables.  The tree is grown to maximum size and not
pruned back.
5.  Use the tree to predict out-of-bag data.
6.  In the end, use the predictions on out-of-bag data to form majority
votes.
7.  Prediction of test data is done by majority votes from predictions from
the ensemble of trees.

In the tech report
http://oz.berkeley.edu/users/breiman/randomforest2001.pdf, Breiman showed
that this technique is very competitive to boosting classification trees.
In our own experience, it is competitive with nonlinear classifiers such as
artificial neural nets and support vector machines.  Two of the significant
advantages of random forests over other methods (IMHO) are: a) there is only
one parameter (mtry) to adjust, and the result usually not sensititve to it;
and b) the built-in cross-validation via the use of out-of-bag data gives
quite accurate estimate of test set error, and offers quite effective
protection against overfitting.

The code is based on version 3.1 of the original Fortran code written by
Breiman and Cutler (http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/breiman/).  The User
Guide for the Fortran code on Breiman's web site explains some of the
facilities provided in the code (such as assessing variable importance, and
proximity measures).  Some facilities provided in the original Fortran code
have be taken out:  transforming data to principal components, and
multidimensional scaling of the "proximity" matrix.  These can easily be
done in R before and after calls to the random forest functions.  Random
numbers are generated by R's RNG, rather than the one supplied in the
original Fortran code.

I'd like to thank Profs. B. D. Ripley, J. Lindsey, and others on R-help that
answered many of my questions when I was working on this package.  The
formula interface and part of the code in the predict method are out-right
"stolen" from svm() in the e1071 package and nnet() in the VR bundle.

Questions/comments/bugs/patches welcomed!

Andy

Subject: Hmisc 1.0 Available
Message-ID: <20020407164124.561224bb.fharrell@virginia.edu>


After taking much longer than I had hoped, the Hmisc library version 1.0 is now available for Linux/Unix/Windows.  The web page for Hmisc is
http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/Hmisc.html from which you can download the ready-to-install package.  See  http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/help/Hmisc/html/Overview.html
for an overview of the library.  R users will be particularly interested in the semi-advanced LaTeX table-making functions by Heiberger and Harrell, and in sas.get, summary.formula (for moderate-level table making and graphical summaries), summarize, and extensions to Lattice graphics that allow for error bars, bands, filled bands, and automatic legend drawing.  There are many utility functions, such as labcurve for labeling curves where they are most separated or for drawing legends in the most empty region of a plot.  There are many high-level and some low-level graphics functions and some sample size/power functions.

The Design library will not be far behind.  For both libraries, the last things to work will be the examples, as my help files currently contain much example code and its printed output that will not execute.

Please send error reports directly to me, with simple examples causing failure if possible.

I wish to thank several people who, besides the helpful group of
R-core members, assisted in porting the Hmisc library to R:

Xiao Gang Fan <xiao.gang.fan1 at libertysurf.fr> kindly creates Windows
distributions of the library from my Linux/Unix version. 

Patrick Connolly <P.Connolly at hortresearch.co.nz> wrote an R version of
the print.char.matrix function that allows the summary.formula
function to print boxed tables.  Patrick's function will be of general
interest to many users [in S-Plus, print.char.matrix is used to print
the output from crosstabs].

Paul Murrell <paul at stat.auckland.ac.nz> wrote the grid package and
Deepayan Sarkar <deepayan at stat.wisc.edu> wrote the lattice package.
Paul and Deepayan displayed amazing patience in answering many of my
questions, and they made imrovements in their packages to allow me to
better use them in Hmisc.

Don MacQueen <macq at llnl.gov> provided major fixes to sas.get for R for
POSIX date, time, and date/time variables and for use of scan.

Peter Malewski <malewski.peter at mh-hannover.de> and Tom Short
<TShort at epri-peac.com> provided information about several errors in a
pre-release of Hmisc.

Thanks to all developers and contributors to R.

Sincerely,

Frank Harrell

Subject: New Package: ipred - Improved predictors
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0204091937400.28610-100000@imbe78.imbe.med.uni-erlangen.de>



The package ipred is uploaded to CRAN.

The main focus of the package is the calculation of improved predictors
in classification tasks. Misclassification error can be improved by
bootstrap aggregated classification trees and/or
the framework of indirect classification. Furthermore, a unified
interface for the estimation of misclassification error
completes the features of ipred.

We try to make the interface as general as possible, however nothing is
carved in stone and suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

Seats are still available for the S-PLUS Essentials course May 13/16 in
London.

R-users may choose to register for just the command line portion of the
course, as that
material is most relevant to them.

S-PLUS Essentials is a hands-on training course that covers a broad spectrum
of topics from importing data to fitting statistical models. At the
conclusion of the course the student will have a working knowledge of the
syntax of the S-PLUS language.  Both traditional and trellis graphs will be
explored. In addition to function writing in the context of graphing and
statistics, the course will present tools for connecting to C-code. While
the material is presented here in the Windows environment, references to
Unix are made where appropriate.

I'm a PhD student and I'm working with covariance function. I'm interested
to know if exist some packages in R to calculate and plot the
bidimensional Autocovariance Function. the input matrix is a matrix that
describe a spatial location over a 2-D space and I want to use it in the
same way I can use a time serie in the 1-D acf.
Thanks,
Nicola.

Subject: R-1.5.0 is released 
Message-ID: <x2vgaaycfa.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've rolled up R-1.5.0.tgz a short while ago. This is a major upgrade,
with several new features. 

A few of the changes generate compatibility issues. You may wish to
consult http://developer.r-project.org/150update.txt.

A set of recommended packages which have been tested with R-1.5.0 has
been bundled up. Binary distributions are expected to include these
packages.

You can get the files from the developer site

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0.tgz
ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0-recommended.tgz

or

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0.tgz
http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0-recommended.tgz

or wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. Binaries for
various platforms will appear in due course.

There are also versions split for floppies.


        For the R Core Team,

        Peter D.


Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.5.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	XDR support is now guaranteed to be available, so the default
	save format will always be XDR binary files, and it is safe to
	distribute data in that format.  (We are unaware of any
	platform that did not support XDR in recent versions of R.)

	gzfile() is guaranteed to be available, so the preferred
	method to distribute sizeable data objects is now via
	save(compress = TRUE).

    o	pie() replaces piechart() and defaults to using pastel colours.

    o	formatC has new arguments (see below) and formatC(*, d = <dig>)
	is no longer valid and must be written as formatC(*, digits = <dig>).

    o	Missingness of character strings is treated much more
	consistently, and the character string "NA" can be used as a
	non-missing value.

    o   summary.factor() now uses a stable sort, so the output will
	change where there are ties in the frequencies.


NEW FEATURES

    o   Changes in handing missing character strings:

        -  "NA" is no longer automatically coerced to a missing value
	   for a character string.  Use as.character(NA) where a missing
	   value is required, and test via is.na(x) not x == "NA".
	   String "NA" is still converted to missing by scan() and
	   read.table() unless `na.strings' is changed from the default.

        -  A missing character string is now printed as `NA' (no quotes)
	   amongst quoted character strings, and `<NA>' if amongst
	   unquoted character strings.

        -  axis() and text.default() omit missing values of their
	   `labels' argument (rather than plotting "NA").

        -  Missing character strings are treated as missing much more
	   consistently, e.g. in logical comparisons and in sorts.
	   identical() now differentiates "NA" from the missing string.


    o   Changes in package methods:

	-  New function validSlotNames().

	-  Classes can explicitly have a "data part", formally
	   represented as a .Data slot in the class definition, but
	   implemented consistently with informal structures.  While the
	   implementation is different, the user-level behavior largely
	   follows the discussion in "Programming with Data".

       -   A "next method" facility has been provided, via the function
	   callNextMethod().  This calls the method that would have been
	   selected if the currently active method didn't exist.  See
	   ?callNextMethod().  This is an extension to the API.

       -   Classes can have initialize methods, which will be called
	   when the function new() is used to create an object from the
	   class.  See ?initialize.  This is an extension to the API.

       -   The logic of setGeneric() has been clarified, simplifying
	   nonstandard generic functions and default methods.


    o	Changes in package tcltk:

        -  Now works with the GNOME user interface.

        -  Several new functions allow access to C level Tcl objects. 
	   These are implemented using a new `tclObj' class, and this
	   is now the class of the return value from .Tcl() and tkcmd().


    o	Changes in package ts:

	-  More emphasis on handling time series with missing values
	   where possible, for example in acf() and in the
	   ARIMA-fitting functions.

	-  New function arima() which will replace arima0() in due
           course.  Meanwhile, arima0() has been enhanced in several
           ways.  Missing values are accepted.  Parameter values can
           be initialized and can held fixed during fitting.  There is
           a new argument `method' giving the option to use
           conditional-sum-of-squares estimation.

	-  New function arima.sim().

	-  New datasets AirPassengers, Nile, UKgas and WWWusage,
	   and a expanded version of UKDriverDeaths (as a multiple
	   time series Seatbelts).

	-  New generic function tsdiag() and methods for arima and arima0,
	   to produce diagnostic plots.  Supersedes arima0.diag().

	-  New functions ARMAacf() and ARMAtoMA() to compute
           theoretical quantities for an ARMA process.

	-  New function acf2AR() to compute the AR process with a given
           autocorrelation function.

	-  New function StructTS() to fit structural time series, and
	   new generic function tsSmooth() for fixed-interval
	   state-space smoothing of such models.

	-  New function monthplot() (contributed by Duncan Murdoch).

	-  New functions decompose() and HoltWinters() (contributed by 
	   David Meyer) for classical seasonal decomposition and
	   exponentially-weighted forecasting.


    o	An extensible approach to safe prediction for models with e.g.
	poly(), bs() or ns() terms, using the new generic function
	makepredictcall().  Used by most model-fitting functions
	including lm() and glm().  See ?poly, ?cars and ?ns for
	examples.

    o   acosh(), asinh(), atanh() are guaranteed to be available.

    o   axis() now omits labels which are NA (but still draws the
	tick mark.

    o	Connections to bzip2-ed files via bzfile().

    o   chol() allows pivoting via new argument `pivot'.

    o	cmdscale() now takes rownames from a dist object `d' as well
	as from a matrix; it has new arguments `add' (as S) and `x.ret'.

    o   crossprod() handles the case of real matrices with y = x
	separately (by accepting y = NULL).  This gives a small
	performance gain (suggestion of Jonathan Rougier).

    o   deriv/deriv3() can now handle expressions involving pnorm and
	dnorm (with a single argument), as in S-PLUS.

    o	New function expm1() both in R and in C API, for accurate exp(x)-1;
	precision improvement in pexp() and pweibull() in some cases.
	(PR#1334-5)

    o	New function findInterval() {using new C entry point
	findInterval, see below}.

    o	formatDL() now also works if both items and descriptions are
	given in a suitable list or matrix.

    o	gzfile() is guaranteed to be available, and hence the
	`compress' option to save() and save.image().

    o	hist() now has a method for date-time objects.

    o	library() now checks the dependence on R version (if any) and
	warns if the package was built under a later version of R.

    o	library(help = PKG) now also returns the information about the
	package PKG.

    o	Added function logb(), same as log() but for S-PLUS
	compatibility (where log now has only one argument).

    o   New na.action function na.pass() passes through NAs unaltered.

    o   piechart() has been renamed to pie(), as piechart is a Trellis
	function for arrays of pie charts.  The default fill colours
	are now a set of pastel shades, rather than par("bg").

    o	plclust() in package mva, for more S-PLUS compatibility.

    o	poly() now works with more than one vector or a matrix as input,
	and has a predict method for objects created from a single
	vector.

    o	polyroot() now handles coefficient vectors with terminal
	zeroes (as in S).

    o	New prettyNum() function used in formatC() and format.default()
        which have new optional arguments `big.mark', `big.interval',
        `small.mark', `small.interval', and `decimal.mark'.

    o	print.coefmat() has a new argument 'eps.Pvalue' for determining
        when small P-values should be printed as  "< {...}".

    o   The recover() function has been moved to the base package.
        This is an interactive debugging function, usually a good
        choice for options(error=).  See ?recover.

    o	rep() has a new argument `each' for S-PLUS compatibility.
	The internal call is made available as rep.int(), again for
	help in porting code.

    o	New functions rowSums(), colSums(), rowMeans() and colMeans():
	versions of apply() optimized for these cases.

    o	rug() now has a "..." argument allowing its location to be specified.

    o	scan() can have NULL elements in `what', useful to save space
	when columns need to be discarded.

    o	New option by = "DSTday" for seq.POSIXt().

    o   Changes to sorting:

	-  sort(), sort.list() and order() have a new argument
	   `decreasing' to allow the order to be reversed whilst
	   still preserving ties.

	-  sort() has an option to use quicksort in some cases
	   (currently numeric vectors and increasing order).

	-  The default Shell sort is Sedgewick's variant, around 20%
           faster, and pre-screening for NAs speeds cases without any
	   NAs several-fold.

	-  sort.list() (and order with just one vector) is several
	   times faster for numeric, integer and logical vectors, and
	   faster for character vectors.

    o   New assignment forms of split(); new function unsplit().

    o	New sprintf() function for general C like formatting, from
	Jonathan Rougier.

    o	Argument `split' of summary.{aov,aovlist} is now implemented.

    o	summary.princomp() now has a separate print() method, and
	`digits' is now an argument to the print method and not to
	summary.princomp itself.

    o   An extended version of the trace() function is available,
        compatible with the function in S-PLUS.  Calls to R functions
        can be inserted on entry, on exit, and before any
        subexpressions. Calls to browser() and recover() are useful.
        See ?trace.

    o   New function TukeyHSD() for multiple comparisons in the results
	of aov().  (Formerly function Tukey in package Devore5 by
	Douglas Bates.)

    o	New read-only connections to files in zip files via unz().

    o	warning() has new argument `call.', like stop()'s.

    o	zip.file.extract() is no longer provisional and has an
	"internal" method available on all platforms.

    o	Methods for [, [<- and as.data.frame() for class "POSIXlt".

    o   Much improved printing of matrices and arrays of type "list".

    o	The "Knuth-TAOCP" option for random-number generation has been
	given an option of using the 2002 revision.  See ?RNG for the
	details: the R usage already protected against the
	reported `weakness'.

    o   min/max of integer(0) (or NULL) is now Inf/-Inf, not an
	extreme integer.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	.Alias, reshapeLong(), reshapeWide() are defunct.

    o	arima0.diag() (package ts) is deprecated: use tsdiag() instead.

    o	piechart() is deprecated; renamed to pie().


DOCUMENTATION CHANGES

    o	`Writing R Extensions' now has an example of calling R's
	random numbers from FORTRAN via C.

    o   R itself and all R manuals now have ISBN numbers, please use
        them when citing R or one of the manuals.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	The configure script used when building R from source under Unix
	is now generated using Autoconf 2.50 or later, which has the
	following 'visible' consequences:

	- By default, configure no longer uses a cache file.  Use the
          command line option '--config-cache' (or '-C') to enable
          caching.

	- Key configuration variables such as 'CC' are now *precious*,
          implying that the variables

	  * no longer need to be exported to the environment and can and
            should be set as command line arguments;

	  * are kept in the cache even if not specified on the command
            line, and checked for consistency between two configure runs
            (provided that caching is used, see above);

	  * are kept during automatic reconfiguration as if having been
            passed as command line arguments, even if no cache is used.

	  See the variable output section of 'configure --help' for a
	  list of all these variables.

    o   Configure variable 'FC' is deprecated, and options '--with-g77',
	'--with-f77' and '--with-f2c' are defunct.  Use configure
	variable 'F77' to specify the FORTRAN 77 compiler, and 'F2C' to
	specify the FORTRAN-to-C compiler and/or that it should be used
	even if a FORTRAN 77 compiler is available.

    o	Non-standard directories containing libraries are specified
	using configure variable 'LDFLAGS' (not 'LIBS').


UTILITIES

    o	Sweave(), Stangle() and friends in package tools.  Sweave allows
	mixing LaTeX documentation and R code in a single source file:
	the R code can be replaced by its output (text, figures) to
	allow automatic report generation.  Sweave files found in
	package subdir 'inst/doc' are automatically tested by R CMD
	check and converted to PDF by R CMD build, see the section on
	package vignettes in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.

    o	Rdconv can convert to the S4 '.sgml' format.

    o   R::Utils.pm masks some platform dependencies in perl code by
        providing global variables like R_OSTYPE or wrapper functions
        like R_runR().

    o   If a directory 'inst/doc' is present in the sources of a
        package, the HTML index of the installed package has a link to
        the respective subdirectory.

    o	R CMD check is more stringent: it now also fails on malformed
	'Depends' and 'Maintainer' fields in 'DESCRIPTION' files, and on
	unbalanced braces in Rd files.  It now also provides pointers to
	documentation for problems it reports.

    o	R CMD check, build and INSTALL produce outline-type output.

    o	QA functions in package 'tools' now return the results of their
	computations as objects with suitable print() methods.  By
	default, output	is only produced if a problem was found.

    o	New utility R CMD config to get the values of basic R configure
	variables, or the header and library flags necessary for linking
	against R.

    o   Rdindex and maketitle.pl require perl 5.005, as Text::Wrap::fill
	was only introduced at 5.004_05.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	All the double-precision BLAS routines are now available,
	and package writers are encouraged not to include their own
	(so enhanced ones will be used if requested at configuration).

    o	findInterval(xt[],n,x,...) gives the index (or interval number)
	of x in the sorted sequence xt[].  There's an
	F77_SUB(interv)(.) to be called from Fortran; this used to be
	part of predict.smooth.spline's underlying Fortran code.

    o	Substitutes for (v)snprintf will be used if the OS does not
	supply one, so tests for HAVE_(V)SNPRINTF are no longer needed.

    o	The DUP and NAOK arguments in a .C() call are not passed on
	to the native routine being invoked.  Any code that relied on
	the old behaviour will need to be modified.

    o	log1p is only provided in Rmath.h if it is not provided by the
	platform, in which case its name is not remapped, but a
	back-compatibility entry point Rf_log1p is provided.
	Applications using libRmath may need to be re-compiled.

    o	The methods used by optim() and integrate() have entry points in
	R_ext/Applic.h and have a more general interface documented in
	`Writing R Extensions'.

    o	The bessel_? entry points are now suitable to be called
	repeatedly from code loaded by .C().  (They did not free
	memory until .C() returned in earlier versions of R.)

    o	Server sockets on non-Windows platforms now set the SO_REUSEADDR
	socket option.  This allows a server to create simultanous
	connections to several clients.

    o	New quicksort sorting (for numeric no-NA data), accessible from
        C as R_qsort() etc and from Fortran as qsort4() and qsort3().

    o	Rinternals.h no longer includes fcntl.h, as this is not an
	ISO C header and cannot be guaranteed to exist.

    o	Fortran subroutines are more correctly declared as `extern void'
	in R_exts/Applic.h and R_exts/Linpack.h.


BUG FIXES

    o	The calculation of which axes to label on a persp() plot was
	incorrect in some cases.

    o	Insufficient information was being recorded in the display list
	for the identify() function.  In particular, the "plot="
	argument was ignored when replaying the display list. (PR#1157)

    o	The vertical alignment of mathematical annotations was wrong.
	When a vertical adjustment was not given, it was bottom-adjusting
	i.e,. it was treating adj=0 as adj=c(0, 0).  It now treats
	adj=0 as adj=c(0, 0.5) as for "normal" text. (PR#1302)

    o	the man page (doc/R.1) wasn't updated with the proper VERSION.

    o	smooth.spline() had a "df = 5" default which was never used and
	hence extraneous and misleading.

    o	read.fwf() was interpreting comment chars in its call to scan:
	replaced by a call to readlines(). (PR#1297/8)

    o	The default has been changed to scan(comment.char="") for
	consistency with earlier code (as in the previous item).

    o	bxp(*, notch.frac = f) now draws the median line correctly.

    o	Current versions of gs were rotating the output of
	bitmap(type = "pdfwrite") and when converting the output
	of postscript() to PDF; this has been circumvented by
	suppressing the %%Orientation comment for non-standard
	paper sizes.

    o	plot.ts(x, log = "y") works again when x has 0s, also for matrix x.

    o	add1(), drop1(), step() work again on glm objects with
	formulae with rhs's containing `.'.  (Broken by a `bug fix'
	(in reality an API change) in 1.2.1.)

    o	optim(method="BFGS") was not reporting reaching `maxit'
	iterations in the convergence component of the return value.

    o	aov() and model.tables() were failing on multistrata models with
	excessively long Error formula. (PR#1315)

    o	Transparent backgrounds on png() devices on Unix-alikes had
	been broken during the driver changes just prior to 1.4.0.
	(They worked correctly on Windows.)

    o	demo(is.things) didn't work properly when the methods package was
	attached.

    o	match(), unique() and duplicated() were not declaring all NaNs to be
	equal, yet not always distinguishing NA and NaN.  This was
	very rare except for data imported as binary numbers.

    o   The error handler recover() protects itself against errors in
        dump.frames and uses a new utility, limitedLabels, to generate
        names for the dump that don't inadvertently blow the limit on
        symbol length.  (TODO:  either fix dump.frames accordingly or
        remove the limit--say by truncating very long symbols?)

    o	se.contrasts() works more reliably with multistratum models,
	and its help page has an example.

    o	summary.lm() was not returning r.squared nor adj.r.squared for
	intercept-only models, but summary.lm.null() was returning
	r.squared but not adj.r.squared.  Now both are always
	returned.  Neither returned f.statistic, and that is now
	documented.

    o	Subsetting of matrices of mode list (or other non-atomic
	modes) was not implemented and gave incorrect results without
	warning. (PR#1329)
	Under some circumstances subsetting of a character matrix
	inserted NA in the wrong place.

    o   abs() was not being treated as member of the Math group
	generic function, so e.g. its method for data frames was not
	being used.

    o	set.seed(seed, "default") was not using the `seed' value (only
	for kind = "default").

    o	logLik.lm() now uses  "df = p + 1" again (`+ sigma'!).

    o	logLik.glm() was incorrect for families with estimated dispersion.

    o	Added strptime() workaround for those platforms (such as
	Solaris) that returned missing components as 0.  Missing
	days are now detected, but missing years will still
	be interpreted as 1900 on such platforms.

    o   Inheritance in formal classes (the methods package) works
        breadth-first as intuition would expect.

    o	The new() function in package `methods' works better (maybe even
        correctly?) for the various combinations of super-classes and
        prototypes that can be supplied as unnamed arguments.

    o	Internal code allowed one more connection to be allocated than
	the table size, leading to segfaults. (PR#1333)

    o	If a user asks to open a connection when it is created and
	it cannot be opened, the connection is destroyed before returning
	from the creation call.  (related to PR#1333)

    o	Sys.putenv() was not using permanent storage. (PR#1371)

    o	La.svd() was not coercing integer matrices. (PR#1363)

    o	deriv(3) now reports correctly the function it cannot find
	the derivatives table.

    o   The GNOME user interface was over-enthusiastic about setting
        locale information.  Now only LC_CTYPE, LC_COLLATE and LC_TIME
        are determined by the user's environment variables (PR#1321)

    o   In X11, locator() would sound the bell even if "xset b off"
        had been set.

    o	merge() could be confused by inconsistent use of as.character()
	giving leading spaces.

    o   [pqr]binom() no longer silently round the `size' argument,
	but return NaN (as dbinom() does). (PR#1377)

    o	Fixed socket writing code to block until all data is written.
	Fixed socket reading code to properly handle long reads and reads
	with part of the data in the connection buffer.

    o	Allow sockets to be opened in binary mode with both open="ab" and
	open="a+b".

    o	levels<-.factor() was using incorrectly list values longer than
	the number of levels (PR#1394), and incorrectly documented
	that a character value could not be longer than the existing
	levels.

    o   The pdf() device was running out of objects before the
	documented 500 page limit.  Now there is no limit.

    o   legend() did not deal correctly with `angle' arguments. (PR#1404)

    o   sum() tried to give an integer result for integer arguments,
	but (PR#1408)
	- this was not documented
	- it sometimes warned on overflow, sometimes not
	- it was order-dependent for a mixture of integer and numeric args.

    o	mean() gave (numeric) NA if integer overflow occurred in sum(),
	but now always works internally with numeric (or complex) numbers.

    o	sort.list() and order() were treating NA_STRING as "NA".

    o	sort.list(na.last = NA) was not implemented.

    o	seq.default() was returning only one element for a relative
	range of less than about 1e-8, which was excessively conservative.
	(PR#1416)

    o	tsp(x) <- NULL  now also works after library(methods).

    o	persp(shade=) was not working correctly with the default
	col=NULL if this was transparent. (PR#1419)

    o	min/max(complex(0)) was returning a random value.

    o   range() gave c(1, 1).

    o	range(numeric(0)) is now c(Inf, -Inf), as it was documented to be.

    o   print.ts() was occasionally making rounding errors in the labels
	for multiple calendar time series.

    o   Rdconv was not handling nested \describe{} constructs when
	converting to HTML (PR#1257) and not fixing up mal-formed
	\item fields in \describe{} when converting to text (PR#1330).

    o   filled.contour() was not checking consistency of x, y, z.
	(PR#1432)

    o   persp.default() no longer crashes with non-character labels.
	(PR#1431)

    o   fft() gave incorrect answers for input sizes 392, 588, 968, 980 ....
	(PR#1429)

    o   det(method = "qr") gave incorrect results for numerically
	singular matrices. (PR#1244)

    o   barplot() now allows the user to control `xpd'. (PR#1088, 1398)

    o   library() (with no arguments) no longer fails on empty TITLE files.

    o   glm() was failing if both offset() and start were specified. (PR#1421)

    o	glm() might have gotten confused if both step-shortening and
	pivoting had occurred (PR#1331).  Step-halving to avoid the
	boundary of feasible values was not working.

    o   Internal representation of logical values was not being
	treated consistently. (Related to PR#1439)

    o   The c() function sometimes inserted garbage in the name vector
        for some types of objects, e.g.  names(c(ls, a=1)).

    o   Fixed bug in `$' that could cause mutations on assignment (PR#1450).

    o   Some X servers displayed random bytes in the window title of
	graphics windows (PR#1451)

    o   The X11 data editor would segfault if closed with window manager
        controls (PR#1453)

    o	Interrupt of Sys.sleep() on UNIX no longer causes subsequent
	Sys.sleep() calls to segfault due to infinite recusion.

    o   Eliminated a race condition that could cause segfaults when a SIGINT
	was received while handling an earlier SIGINT.

    o   rect(lty = "blank") was incorrectly drawing with a dashed line.

    o   type.convert() was not reporting incorrectly formatting complex 
	inputs. (PR#1477)

    o   readChar() was not resetting vmax, so causing memory build-up.
	(PR#1483)

From fharrell at virginia.edu  Mon Apr 29 17:12:21 2002
From: fharrell at virginia.edu (Frank E Harrell Jr)
Date: Mon, 29 Apr 2002 11:12:21 -0400
Subject: Release of Design library; update of Hmisc library
Message-ID: <20020429111221.01cbe942.fharrell@virginia.edu>


The Design library has been fully ported to R except for Cox proportional hazards regression modeling (using Therneau's survival package) which will be available in about two weeks.  It will take much longer to make all the example code executable, is it currently contains many examples for which data are not provided.  Thanks to Xiao Gang Fan <xiao.gang.fan1 at libertysurf.fr> who kindly compiled Design for Windows.  I also thank Doug Bates <bates at stat.wisc.edu> and Charles Berry <cberry at tajo.ucsd.edu> who provided details to make it easy to change LINPACK calls from S-Plus to R, and Robert Gentleman <rgentlem at jimmy.harvard.edu> and Thomas Lumley <tlumley at u.washington.edu> who provided help in dealing with formula terms objects.

The Design library implements methods used in my 2001 Springer book Regression Modeling Strategies (see http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/rms).  The web page for Design is
http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/Design.html from which you
can download the ready-to-install package.  See
http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/help/Design/html/Overview.html 
for a detailed overview of the library.

Design does regression modeling, testing, estimation, validation, graphics, prediction, and typesetting by storing enhanced model design attributes in the fit.  Design is a collection of about 180 functions that assist and streamline modeling, especially for biostatistical and epidemiologic applications.  It also contains new functions for binary and ordinal logistic regression models and the Buckley-James multiple regression model for right-censored responses, and implements penalized maximum likelihood estimation for logistic and ordinary linear models.  Design works with almost any regression model, but it was especially written to work with logistic regression, Cox regression, accelerated failure time models, and ordinary linear models.  

You should install the Hmisc library before using Design, as a few of Design's options use Hmisc functions, and Hmisc has several functions useful for data analysis (especially data reduction and imputation).


Peter Malewski <peter.malewski at gmx.de> provided many more bug fixes for the Hmisc library, and Xiao Gang Fan kindly compiled the latest Hmisc for Windows.  New versions of Hmisc for all platforms may be obtained from http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/library/r .  The new versions are required when using Design.

Subject: R 150 for MacOS (Carbon R) released
Message-ID: <12D955C7-5C75-11D6-AE75-003065CC4CB8@mclink.it>


I have just updated the CRAN with the latest build of R 150.
The archive also contains all the base and recommended packages.

It will be mirrored in a couple of days or so.

Contributed packages will follow in few days.

Stefano M. Iacus


Here the Changes for version 1.5.0

		Macintosh-specific changes to R
		===============================

rm150
=====

* using dev.off() when a user close a windows instead
   of killing directly the device
* changed MPWBuild to take care of changes in the src/include
   directory
* fixed a bug with path length (Thanks to T.Lumley)
* fixed a problem with building help files. In particular,
   html help files now have correct links
* added system() functionality under MacOS X. When R is
   running under MacOS X, it is now possibile to run BSD
   shell commands via the system() R command. Very limited
   at the moment but working.
* fixed the problem with the error message: "negative length vectors
   are not allowed". Now you should not experiment this anymore.
* MacZip not needed anymore.


Note for developers:
--------------------

For the people who want to build R from sources: you should the replace 
the file src/macintosh/MPWBuild with the one you find in this prebuilt 
distribution of R for Macintosh. See details in the file README_MAC.TXT 
inside rm150 folder.

Subject: Spatial statistics - new version of spdep
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0205011138220.28022-100000@reclus.nhh.no>


Spatial statistics: A new version of the spdep package (0.1-4) is now
available from CRAN. This package contains all of the functions in the
former packages spweights, sptests, and spsarlm. They are no longer being
maintained and have been deprecated. Users are asked to REMOVE the old
component packages and replace them with the single spdep package, so
that update.packages() will do its magic in the future.

This release contains minor changes to existing functions, as well as the
Cressie/Read North Carolina SIDS data set, and the Harrison/Rubinfeld
Boston housing data set as corrected by Gilley and Pace (with census tract
point positions).

Subject: R 1.5.0 RPM's for Mandrake
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33L2.0205021623170.2165-100000@localhost.localdomain>



RPM's and SRPM's for Mandrake versions 8.1 and 8.2 have been uploaded and
will be mirrored on CRAN shortly.

Please note that the binary -1mdk rpm's are for mandrake 8.1 while the
-2mdk rpm's are for 8.2, install the correct version for your system.

People with mandrake 8.0 or earlier can easily build (and hopefully
contribute) binaries; consult the readme file for instructions.

Please note: Mandrake 8.2 comes without netscape; the help.start()
function must therefore be started as:

help.start(browser = 'mozilla')

N.B. :
Unfortunately I have not yet figured out how to get the search applet on
the help page working - mozilla just refuses to initialize the applet even
though the java subsystem I have apparently works with applets on other
sites (e.g. www.avsi.org). This happens both with the version shipped with
8.1 and with the version shipped with 8.2 (I've tried sun java and IBM
java).  An error messages flashes on the bottom bar for an instant,
something about 'impossible to access'. If any Mandrake guru figures out
why, please post. Meanwhile, 8.2 users could consider installing netscape.

Subject: mgcv 0.8 released
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.21.0205051856200.21846-100000@dolphin>


mgcv version 0.8-0 is now on CRAN. mgcv provides generalized additive
models with automatic smoothing parameter selection. Models may include
smooths of more than one variable. This release fixes one platform
dependent problem that could result in convergence problems/ unstable
models, provides facilities for using multi-dimensional smooths with very
large data sets, provides a mechanism for conditioning smooths on factors,
allows terms like s(x)+s(y)+s(x,y) in formulae and has improved
convergence diagnostics. Full details are at:

Currently it only has the base distribution. Unpack in /usr/local. In
addition you may need many dylibs from fink. This version has
support for gnome, but not for atlas yet. It also has libR.dylib.
Recommended packages will come later.

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Mon Jun 17 14:06:16 2002
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)

Subject: R-1.5.1 is released
Message-ID: <x2n0tu6rev.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-1.5.1.tgz a short while ago. This is a patch upgrade,
fixing the most important bugs that cropped up after the 1.5.0 release.

A set of recommended packages which have been tested with R-1.5.1 has
been bundled up. Binary distributions should include these packages.

You can get the files from the developer site

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.1.tgz
ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.1-recommended.tgz

or

http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.5.1.tgz
http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.5.1-recommended.tgz

or wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. Binaries for
various platforms will appear in due course.

There are also versions split for floppies and a patch file against 1.5.0.


        For the R Core Team,

        Peter D.

 NOTE: I discovered late in the release process that there is still a
 small problem with the 8.0.x tcl/tk compatibility. A fix is
 forthcoming.

Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.5.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	Enhancements to mathematical annotation of plots:

	- expressions involving dot(<something>) now produce a dot accent
	  above the <something> (initial patch from Ben Bolker).

	- within an expression, the symbol partialdiff is now converted
	  to a partial differential symbol (greek delta).

    o	smooth.spline() has a new argument `nknots' allowing to set the
	default number of knots (when `all.knots = FALSE' as per default).


BUG FIXES

    o	Rdconv now skips CRs in input files, even on Unix.

    o	readBin() had a (very slow) memory leak if changing size or reading
	character strings.  writeChar() had a memory leak.

    o	polygon() and rect() with lty = "blank" were omitting the fill
	colour (if present).  symbols(circles=, lty="blank") was
	drawing the border of the disks.

    o	Subsetting non-existent rows in a data frame would produce
	missing row names, which are not allowed.

    o	On Unix, R_PAPERSIZE was set to '' instead of 'a4' as default on
	systems without paperconf.

    o	Under GNOME, capabilities() now reports correctly that X11, png
	and jpeg are available (if they are under X11).

    o	The names of some results of unlist() had the wrong internal
	length, which confused paste().	 Both have been corrected. (PR#1524)

    o	RweaveLatex.Rd had unbalanced braces in section "Supported
	Options".

    o	merge() with multiple and differently-named match columns
	failed. (PR#1510)

    o	NAs in right-justified unquoted character matrices were being
	mis-aligned.  This mainly affected printing data frames.

    o	predict.*bSpline() bugs extrapolating for deriv >= 1 (PR#1473),
	and predict.[bn]s bug e.g. for bs(x), reported by Ch.Sangiorgio.

    o	qr.X was failing if n < p.  Fixed, but only in the case when
	pivoting does not occur. (PR#1519)

    o	xx[, 1:3] was returning a list if xx had only one row, even
	though xx[1, 1:3] was a data frame. (PR#1530)

    o	nls() was reporting incorrectly the number of iterations if the
	maximum was reached.

    o	rbind.data.frame() was coercing logical columns to factors.
	(PR#1536)

    o	Rprof(NULL) or Rprof("") called when not profiling caused a
	segfault: now silently ignored.	 (PR#1471)

    o	On systems (e.g. Windows) using R's own code for expm1, the
	values were wrong for large negative x, and this affected
	pweibull(), for example.

    o	prettyNum(*, bigmark=*) added extra marks in some cases. (PR#1548)

    o	cut.dendrogram() failed in some cases. (PR#1552)

    o	The links in refman.pdf were broken by a single invalid
	\alias{}. Now Rdconv checks more comprehensively. (PR#1550)

    o	predict(smooth.spline(x,*), deriv =1) did not predict at all `x'
	values, and
	smooth.spline(x,*, all.knots = TRUE) used much too much memory
	when length(x) was largish.
	smooth.spline(*, .... trace = TRUE ..) is a bit more self-explaining.

    o	pexp(x, log=TRUE) and pweibull(*) were losing precision for large x.

    o	Workaround for NetBSD bug in compiling dounzip.c. (PR#1565/6)

    o	Conversions to numeric in type.convert were always treating "NA" as
	missing whatever the setting of na.strings. (PR#1568)

    o	R CMD check now deals correctly with package names containing a
	'.' in the Depends field of a DESCRIPTION file. (PR#1591)

    o	pbinom() and pbinom() were misssing the "fuzz" that other discrete
	distributions have in order to guard against truncation.

    o	The "=" assignment operator behaved as "<<-" in some constructions
	with composite left-hand sides.

    o	Added print.AsIs() method to ensure "AsIs" objects are printed
	by the method for their real class. (PR#1587)

    o	mosaicplot(*, color = v) now recycles v[] if needed.

    o	Calling dev.control("inhibit") with no graphics device open
	crashed R. (PR#1605)

    o	read.dcf() was not checking that memory allocation succeeded.

    o	The C function fprec might overflow for > 16 digits, showing
	up in example(str) on some platforms.

    o	Changes to the methods package:

	- Nonstandard generic function definitions given to
	  setGeneric now work; these were previously ignored.

	- Classes that extend matrix, etc. as the data part previously lost
	  their attributes.

	- There were bugs in distinguishing methods for "missing" from
	  methods for "ANY".

	- Some coerce methods were not selected correctly when the two classes
	  were related by an "is" relation.

	- extends() now works correctly if given a class definition rather
	  than a name.

	- class()<- was leaving in an explicit class attribute for basic data
	  types.

	- Method signatures including arguments following "..." in the
	  argument list of the generic didn't work.

    o	par(mgp = v) now allows negative `v' (S-compatibly and sensibly).

    o	identify.hclust() masked its `x' argument and so failed.

    o	System rint was never being used in fround.c.

    o	round/trunc.POSIXt were erroneously retaining information on
	DST. (PR#1543)

    o	tcltk package didn't work with tcl8.0.x.  Compatibility code
	inserted (PR#1640, thanks to Ren? Bertin for helping out with
	this).

    o	selfStart() {pkg "nls"} now works again when parameter names are
	not specified (but implicit).

    o	legend() now treats lty="0" properly (as solid).

    o	ARMAacf was failing if 0 < p < q+1: it failed to say that ar needed
	to be padded with zeroes, and now the code does that.

    o	old.packages() was assuming a bundle was installed in only one
	library, and so update.packages() would only update a bundle
	in the first location in lib.loc.

    o	fisher.test() could miscalculate odds ratio and confidence
	interval for tables with large entries, due to numerical
	overflow.

    o	Using lty = "1" (or "10") does no longer produce invalid
	postscript or pdf.  Using "0" in a character lty is currently not
	implemented device-independently and needs more fixing.

    o	ccf(plot = FALSE) was returning a spurious extra 0 at lag 0.

    o	On console-based versions of R (Windows, GNOME, probably
	MacOS) warning/error messages longer than 8192 chars could
	crash R. (PR#1651)

    o	Comparisons between objects of mode "call" using "==" now return
	TRUE if both sides deparse to the same string (as always intended).

    o	HoltWinters() now initializes correctly in the exponential
	smoothing case, and plot.HoltWinters() allows lty to be set.

    o	fisher.test() crashed due to corruption on some large
	problems.  It also crashed on tables with total one. (PR#1662)

    o	The substitution code for strptime (used e.g. on Windows)
	cached the month names and so did not recognise locale changes
	during an R session, as used by get.hist.quote{tseries}.
	Caching has been supressed.  (PR#1116)

    o	Some functions used the non-existing error() function instead
	of stop().

    o	vector("complex",n)  doesn't return random garbage anymore.

R 1.5.1 binary packages for Mandrake 8.2 and source packages for 
Mandrake have been uploaded to CRAN.

People wishing to contribute RPM's for Mandrake 8.1 or 8.0 are welcome to 
do so and will find complete instructions in the Mandrake-readme file.

The 8.2 binary package adopts mozilla as default browser as this 
distribution no longer ships netscape; however, as Netscape 4.7 series is 
the only browser with which the help.start() search applet works on 
Mandrake I suggest people might like to download and install the 8.1 
netscape rpm on 8.2 systems as I have. 

The SRPM will still build a package with netscape as default browser.

Hello!

Good news for the SuSE fans out there.
I?ve just completed the upload of rpms for SuSE 7.3 and 8.0
to the master site. You?ll probably find them on CRAN tomorrow morning. 

The archiv has rpms for R-1.5.1 and roughly 130 contrib packages.

If you are missing a package, consult the build logs before asking, please.
Some of the missings failed "make check", others were missing some libraries on
my system.
When time permitts I?ll try to complete the collection. 

Thanks again to Albrecht Gebhardt, who formerly maintained the packages!


Happy downloading!

Subject: Carbon R 1.5.1 + Bioconductor released
Message-ID: <77CD881E-82CD-11D6-A244-003065CC4CB8@mclink.it>


I have built and uploaded to CRAN the Carbon version of R for 
MacOS/MacOSX.

You'll find the base set (rm151.sit) and the recommended packages 
(recommended.sit) separately or all in one single file (rm151_FULL.sit) 
on CRAN and their mirrors soon.

I have also built the Bioconductor suite of packages (corresponding to 
the Bioconductor_1.0.tgz file) as it seems to be one of the most 
appealing packages for Mac users.

You'll find it in the macos/contrib/rm151  folder on CRAN.

Other packages will follow.

This version of R contains a fully working methods library.

I put the Windows build of R 1.5.1 online yesterday, but due to an
error in one of my scripts, it included obsolete versions of VR and
survival.  I'm in the process of uploading a corrected version.  It
will show up on CRAN sometime later today or tomorrow, and on the
mirrors soon after that.

If you've already downloaded the Windows release (or you do so before
the new version shows up), you can get the latest versions of those
packages using the "Packages|Update packages from CRAN"  menu
selection in Rgui.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0206201743230.24563-100000@artemis>



New package `multcomp' for general multiple comparisons

	written by Frank Bretz, Torsten Hothorn and Peter Westfall

We've uploaded the package `multcomp' to CRAN.
The R package allows for multiple comparisons of
k groups in general linear models. We use the unifying
representations of multiple contrast tests, which include all
common multiple comparison procedures, such as the many-to-one
comparisons of Dunnett, the all-pairwise comparisons of Tukey and
many other procedures. We provide a list of 9
standard procedures (Dunnett, Tukey, Sequen, AVE, Changepoint,
Williams, Marcus, McDermott, Tetrade), where the user selects the 
comparisons of his interest. In addition, a free input interface 
for the contrast matrix allows for more special comparisons.

The comparisons itself are not restricted to balanced or simple
designs. Instead, the programs are designed to suit multiple
comparisons within the general linear model, thus allowing for
covariates, nested effects, correlated means and missing values.
The program is designed for the normal set-up with a common (possibly unknown)
variance and a known covariance matrix. But instead of using the
usual Bonferroni and Holm procedures, we take the exact
correlations between the test statistics into account by use of
the multivariate t-distribution. The resulting procedures are
therefore more powerful (the Bonferroni and Holm adjusted 
p-values are reported for reference). We also allow the user to perform an
asymptotic analysis based on the multivariate normal
distribution (as required e.g. in multiple comparisons based on
asymptotic rank transformations; assumed asymptotic normality
when comparing binomial parameters; etc.). Two functions will be
provided. The first one computes confidence intervals for the
common single step procedures (`simint'). This approach can be uniformly
improved by applying the closed testing principle, what is
implemented in the second function (`simtest'; but no confidence intervals
are available for the latter procedure). Use either `csimint' or
`csimtest' if you want to pass the estimates by hand. 

For testing and validation purposes we included some examples from Westfall
et al. (1999).
    
This is a first release and needs some improvement, therefore the user 
interfaces may change in forthcoming versions. Suggestions for 
improvements are very welcome!

Subject: gss_0.7-2
Message-ID: <200206262305.g5QN5xbC023856@odds.stat.purdue.edu>



A new version of the gss package (gss_0.7-2.tar.gz) is on CRAN now.  A
new ssden suite is added for density estimation with up to 4 numeric
r.v.'s; computation in higher dimension can be very slow as numerical
integrations are involved.  Support for discrete variables will be
added in the future.

The utility provides limited support for the nonparametric estimation
of graphical models, as conditional independence structures can be
built in via selective inclusion of terms in ANOVA decompositions of
the log density.

d- and dc- functions are provided for the evaluation of pdf and
conditional pdf.  p-, q-, pc-, qc- functions are provided for 1-D cdf,
quantiles, conditional cdf, and conditional quantiles, respectively.
r- function is missing.

Bug reports and feature suggestions will be appreciated.

A new  version (0.2) of package 'subselect' has been uploaded to CRAN.

Package 'subselect' provides functions to carry out local search
algorithms for k-variable subsets that are optimal, as surrogates for
the full (p-variable, p > k) data sets, under three different criteria.

The functions 'rm.coef', 'rv.coef' and 'gcd.coef' assess the quality
of given k-subsets of variables under the following three 
criteria: RM (McCabe's second criterion for Principal Variables, which
measures the quality of the subset as a linear predictor of all the
variables), RV (based on Escoufier's RV-criterion, which measures the
similarity of the n point configurations defined by the original p variables
and the n point configuration resulting from the regression of all variables
on a k-subset of the variables) and GCD (based on Yanai's GCD, and which
measures the similarity of the subspaces spanned by a k-variable subset, and
a subset of g Principal Components of the full data set). 

Three additional functions, 'anneal', 'genetic' and 'improve', search for
optimal k-variable subsets under those criteria, using three different
algorithms: a simulated annealing algorithm, a genetic algorithm and a
restricted local improvement algorithm. For computational efficiency, the
basic code implementing these algorithms is written in Fortran (with calls
to Lapack subroutines), but the R functions provide a user-friendly
interface where many parameters associated with the algorithms can be
specified. Among the options, the user can control the number of
iterations, initial temperature, cooling factors  
and cooling frequency in simulated annealing, and the number of generations,
population size, admissibility of clones and presence and frequency of
mutations in the 
genetic algorithm. For all algorithms, it is possible to specify the number
of solutions required in one or more cardinalities, to specify the initial
solutions and to force the solutions to include and/or to exclude given
subsets of variables. The results of these functions are lists of R objects
detailing the resulting subsets and values of criteria, which can be
manipulated in R. 

There is a CHANGELOG file in subdirectory 'inst' documenting changes
from Version 0.1.

Here is the DESCRIPTION file for the package:

Package: subselect

Jan,

  the current development version of R does not build in my

net somewhere? Is quartz() the right incantation?

Hi,

A new release of the package RArcInfo is out. I have just uploaded it to
CRAN. This package allows the user to import Arc/Info Version 7.x binary
coverages into R.

 The improvements in this release are:

- Proper compiling under 'Big endian' platforms.

- A new function (read.coverage) has been added for easier coverage
importing. PLease, read the documentation before using it.

- Plots now are resized according the proportions of the map.

- Minor bug fixes.

I hope you find the package interesting and useful.

Regards and have a good holidays,

Subject: new version of the randomForest package
Message-ID: <51F9C42DA15CD311BD220008C707D81906FFC60A@usrymx10.merck.com>


I have just uploaded to CRAN the new version of the randomForest package.
Those who had used the previous version will absolutely want to upgrade, as
the new version fixes a few serious bugs (some giving wrong results w/o
warning or error).  This version matches version 3.3 of the classification
code and version 1.0 of the regression code on Prof. Breiman's web site.

The package provides an R interface to Prof. Breiman's code for regression
and classification by the random forest algorithm.  Details about the
algorithm (and the original Fortran code) can be found on

  http://oz.berkeley.edu/users/breiman

New features and bug fixes include:

o  Random forest for regression problems now incorporated into the package.

o  Factor (categorical) predictors are now handled correctly, especially
through the formula interface.  (The previous version wrongly expands
factors into contrasts.)

o  Ordered factor predictors are now correctly handled.

o  For classification problem, there is an new option for the predict method
to calculate proximity measure for the test data.

o  Calls to R's random number generator from Fortran have been made more
portable.  I believe this was causing segmentation faults on some platforms
in the previous version.

o  The Example section of the help page for randomForest now show some of
the extra things that can be done with the randomForest object.

o  The call to the underlying C/Fortran code no longer copy data (i.e.,
.C(..., DUP=FALSE) is used).  This should reduce memory requirement quite a
bit, especially for large data sets.  This should be fairly safe since data
pass to C/Fortran are copies made at the R level anyway.

o  The version number of the package now tracks the version number of Prof.
Breiman's classification code (i.e., currently 3.3).

o  The spelling of my co-author's name has been corrected!

Because of the limited amount of time I was able to spend on this package,
the code are not the most elegant.  I would appreciate any
comments/suggestions/bugs/patches.

Regards,
Andy

Subject: ape 0.1 is released
Message-ID: <3.0.32.20020905103036.00906db0@162.38.183.200>


Ape is an R package for "analyses of phylogenetics and evolution". The
first version (0.1) has been released on 27 August 2002 and is available on
CRAN. 

>From the 'Description' file of version 0.1:

       Ape provides functions for reading, and plotting
       phylogenetic trees in parenthetic format (standard Newick
       format), analyses of comparative data in a phylogenetic
       framework, analyses of diversification and macroevolution,
       computing distances from allelic and nucleotide data,
       reading nucleotide sequences from GenBank via internet, and
       several tools such as Mantel's test, computation of minimum
       spanning tree, or the population parameter theta based on
       various approaches.

Bug reports, comments and suggestions on Ape are welcome.

Dear all,
at the following address

http://linaria.dst.unive.it/~claudio/R/Rmaterial.html#ga

you can download a package to build simple genetic algorithms. I wrote
this package to introduce genetic algorithms to student in labs, which
means, the package emphasize "how a ga works" instead of "how
fast it could be".

Please, let me know any comments or suggestions,

Bests,
Claudio Agostinelli

Subject: Updates to Hmisc and Design Libraries
Message-ID: <20020921202920.356c965f.fharrell@virginia.edu>


The Hmisc and Design libraries have had major improvements.  New versions for Linux/Unix/Windows may be obtained from http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/library/r

Thanks to Xiao Gang Fan for porting the libraries to Windows once again.

Change logs may be obtained from http://hesweb1.med.virginia.edu/biostat/s/library/common

Several bugs have been fixed in Design, and many bugs have been fixed in Hmisc and new features and functions have been added.  Advanced table making functions related to summary.formula have been enhanced to automatically add results of statistical tests comparing columns in tables.  Some new latex options have been added.  The contents function has been enhanced and an html method written for it.  For example, html(contents(mydataframe)) will produce an html document whose initial part is a table containing variable names, labels, units, storage mode, number of levels, and number of NAs.  The number of levels is hyperlinked to a separate table containin the factor levels.

R help files for Hmisc have been significantly improved.  But there are many aspects of Hmisc and Design help files that still do not pass R CMD CHECK, hence the non-appearance of Hmisc and Design on CRAN.  It will take some time to make all the help files meet CRAN package specifications.

Thanks to those who have reported bugs and fixes.

	CrossTable is an implementation of a cross-tabulation function
 	with output similar to S-Plus crosstabs() and SAS Proc Freq with
	Chi-square and Fisher tests of the independence of table factors

- Permit combinations() to be used when r>n provided   
  repeat.allowed=TRUE

- Renamed 'concat' function to 'combine' to avoid name conflict with
  an existing S-Plus function.

Subject: New version of gregmisc package
Message-ID: <D7A3CFD7825BD6119B880002A58F06C20149CFC6@groexmb02.pfizer.com>



Shortly after the release of version 0.6.0 of the gregmisc package, several
bugs were located by users.  A new release, 0.7.0, is now available on CRAN.


This version corrects these bugs, and adds regression test code.  This
regression test code should to help to prevent introduction of bugs of this
sort in the future

Thanks to Matthew McDonald and Sven Garbade for the bug reports prompted
this re-release.

Subject: new patched version of randomForest
Message-ID: <51F9C42DA15CD311BD220008C707D81906FFC703@usrymx10.merck.com>


There's now a new version of randomForest (3.3-4) on CRAN.  Changes from the
last version include:

o  "Unsupervised learning" now works again.

o  Fixed a bug in the original Fortran: the mtry variables chosen 
   to split each node are now sampled without replacement.

o  Variable importance for regression now works correctly (i.e.,
   reproducible when random seed is set).  The problem was simply
   un-initialized array.  The problem is also in the original
   Fortran code, so users of that beware!

o  A new option keep.forest (default TRUE), which, when set to FALSE,
   supresses the `forest' component of the returned object.  This
   can reduce memory usage and execution time significantly, if
   prediction of test set is not needed.

o  The default value of mtry is now set to sqrt(p) for classification
   and p/3 for regression (where p is the number of predictors), 
   consistent with Prof. Breiman's suggestion.

Questions/comments/bug-reports/patches welcomed!

Andy

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Tue Oct  1 14:01:04 2002
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 01 Oct 2002 14:01:04 +0200
Subject: R-1.6.0 is released
Message-ID: <x2n0pygygv.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-1.6.0.tgz a short while ago. This is a major upgrade,
with several new features. 

A few of the changes generate compatibility issues. You may wish to
consult http://developer.r-project.org/160update.txt.

We no longer ship the set of recommended packages separately, but
bundle them up with the main distribution. Thus there is now only a
single file to fetch and (barring special platform issues) you should
be able to get going by unpacking the sources and entering

./configure
make
make install

You can get it from the developer site

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.6.0.tgz

or

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.6.0.tgz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. Binaries for
various platforms will appear in due course. (Notice that the machine
which hosts cvs.r-project.org had a hardware problem last week, so the
service may be slightly unreliable. Unfortunately, this also affects
some CRAN mirrors since they are redirected through the same machine.)

There is also a version split for floppies.


        For the R Core Team,

        Peter D.


Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.6.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	The default colour palette now has "grey" instead of "white"
	in location 8.	See palette().

    o	grid(nx) behaves differently (but the same as in R versions <= 0.64).


NEW FEATURES

    o	New operator :: in the grammar, for name spaces.

    o	New faster rowsum(), also works on data frames.

    o	grep(), (g)sub() and regexpr() have a new argument `perl'
	which if TRUE uses Perl-style regexps from PCRE (if installed).
	New capabilities option "PCRE" to say if PCRE is available.

    o	Preparations for name space support:

	- Functions in the base package are now defined in a name space.
	  As a temporary measure, you can disable this by defining the
	  environment variable R_NO_BASE_NAMESPACE.

	- UseMethod dispatching now searches for methods in the
	  environment of the caller of the generic function rather
	  than the environment where the generic is defined.

    o	The objects created in the methods package to represent
	classes, generic functions, method definitions, and
	inheritance relations now themselves belong to true classes.  In
	particular, the "classRepresentation" objects follow the description
	in "Programming with Data" (section 7.6).

    o	Other additions and changes to the methods package:

	- The function setOldClass() has been added, following the
	  description on page 450 of "Programming with Data".  Use it
	  if old-style classes are to be supplied in signatures for
	  setMethod, particularly if the old-style classes have
	  inheritance.	Many of the old-style classes in the base
	  package should be pre-specified; try getClass("mlm"), e.g.

	- The setGeneric() function applies some heuristics to warn
	  about possibly erroneous generic function definitions.
	  (Before, obscure bugs could result.)

	- The function promptMethods() has been revised to work better
	  and to provide aliases for individual methods.

	- The behavior of the as() function has been generalized, in
	  particular with a strict= argument, the general goal being
	  to let simple extensions of classes pass through in method
	  dispatch and related computations without altering the
	  objects. More to make method behavior more "natural" than
	  for direct use.

	- Some inconsistencies following detach("package:methods")
	  have been removed, so it _should_ be possible to
	  detach/re-attach the methods package.

    o	New methods ([[, print, str) and extended plot() method
	(incl. logical `horiz') for "dendrogram" class.

    o	sprintf() now checks the agreement between formats and object
	types, and handles special values (NA, Inf, ...) correctly.

    o	chol() now uses a tolerance for non-positive-definiteness and
	so should give more consistent results across platforms.

    o	New function agrep() for approximate (fuzzy) string matching.

    o	help.search() can now use both approximate (fuzzy) and regular
	expression matching.  By default, if the pattern to be matched
	consists of only alphanumeric characters, whitespace or a dash,
	approximate matching is used.

    o	axis() has three new optional arguments `col', `lty', and `lwd'
	all for drawing the axis line and tick marks.

    o	Function vcov() (formerly in MASS), a generic function to
	return the variance-covariance matrix of the parameter
	estimates of a fitted model.

    o	duplicated() and unique() have methods for matrices and arrays
	(based on ideas from Jens Oehlschl?gel).

    o	Internally memory sizes and counts of cons cells are now stored
	in unsigned longs.  This allows memory limits to be set and
	objects created in the range 2-4Gb on 32-bit platforms, and
	allows 64-bit platforms to use much larger amounts of memory.

    o	Command-line flags to set memory can now use the suffix `G'
	for gigabytes.	The setting of maximum vsize is now only
	limited by the platform's address space.

    o	All warning and error messages are truncated to a length set
	by options(warning.length=), defaulting to 1000.  (Previously
	most (but not quite all) were truncated at 8192 characters.)

    o	[dpqr]gamma() check for shape parameter > 0.

    o	as.POSIX[cl]t can now convert logical NAs.

    o	All installed packages (even those shipped with R) are
	given a `Built' field in the DESCRIPTION file.

    o	as.data.frame() now coerces logical matrices into logical
	columns (rather than factors).

    o	[[<-.data.frame no longer coerces character replacement values
	to factor.  This is consistent with using $ to replace and
	with S4.

    o	library() attempts to detect improperly installed packages, so
	as from this version an installed package must have a
	DESCRIPTION file and that file must have been stamped with a
	`Built:' line (which was introduced in 1.2.0).	Under
	Unix-alikes, the platform is checked against that used for
	installation.

    o	print.factor() has new arguments `max.levels' (with a smart default)
	and `width'.  print.ordered() is no longer needed.

    o	RNGkind() has an additional option for normal random generators:
	"Inversion".

    o	data.frame() recycles factors and "AsIs" objects as well as
	atomic vectors.

    o	predict.lm() warns if `newdata' is supplied and the fit was
	rank-deficient, as this can be misleading.

    o	rect() accepts additional graphics parameters through a ...
	argument (in the same way as polygon).

    o	strwidth/strheight() now coerce their first argument in exactly
	the same way text() does, so a wider range of inputs is allowed.

    o	prompt()'s default and data.frame methods have a new 3rd argument
	`name' allowing them to used more easily in scripts and loops.

    o	rgb() has a new `maxColorValue' argument, allowing r,g,b in [0,M],
	particularly in {0:255}, efficiently and non-error-prone.

    o	summaryRprof() provides the functionality of R CMD Rprof in R
	code, though more slowly.

    o	stop() accepts multiple arguments (which are concatenated)
	just as warning() does.

    o	scan() now throws an error with incorrect logical input (which
	was previously taken as FALSE).

    o	pdf() now uses PDF not R code for clipping, which ensures that
	partially visible text strings are (partially) shown.

    o	Each R session uses a per-session temporary directory which
	is removed at normal termination.  The directory name is given
	by the tempdir() function, and filenames returned by
	tempfile() will be within that directory.

    o	help.start() on Unix now uses a .R subdirectory of the
	per-session temporary directory and not ~/.R.  A side effect
	is that ~/.R is now never deleted by R.

	This now uses the remote control mechanism only if the X
	display is local to the R process (as otherwise it might use a
	browser running on an arbitrary machine).

    o	*Very* experimental browseEnv() for browsing objects in an
	environment.

    o	cbind/rbind() used to ignore all zero-length vectors, an
	undocumented quirk for S-compatibility.	 This caused problems
	when combining zero-extent matrices and zero-length vectors, and
	now zero-length vectors are ignored unless the result would
	have zero rows/columns.

    o	read.table(stdin()) will now work.

    o	plot.spec(x) now also works for other x than AR and Pgram results.

    o	New functions La.chol() and La.chol2inv() for Cholesky
	decomposition and inverse of positive definite matrices using
	Lapack.

    o	Changes to the tcltk package

	- on Unix systems, the Tcl event loop has been integrated with
	  R's own (so that tkwait.variable() no longer halts updates of
	  plot windows).

	- also on Unix, stubs have been created to divert R's input
	  and output routines to go via Tcl commands. (Nothing
	  uses this at present, but packages might be developed to
	  take advantage of it.)

	- return value from Tcl commands is no longer invisible. A new
	  print method, print.tclObj(), has been introduced.

	- Tcl variables created by tclVar() are now explicitly put into
	  Tcl's global namespace, removing potential scoping problems.

	- The tcltk dynamic library now loads with local=FALSE since
	  the default had trouble when loading Tcl extensions
	  (e.g. Tix)

	- The tkpager() function had not been updated for the return
	  value change from 1.5.0

    o	The bmp(), jpeg() and png() devices can produce multiple
	bitmap files, one for each page.  The default filenames have been
	changed to include a sequence number.

    o	New function axTicks() returning tick mark locations like axis().

    o	grid() has a more sensible default behavior.  Tick axis alignment
	only happens when no numbers of grid cells are specified.  New
	arguments lwd and equilogs; nx/ny = NA for not drawing, see ?grid.

    o	installed.packages() has a new argument `priority'.

    o	termplot() uses factor levels rather than 1,2,3... for x-axis.

    o	Workaround for optimization bugs on gcc 3.1/2 on 32-bit Solaris.

    o	The trace() function has been robustified and a new function
	tracingState() added to turn tracing temporarily on and off.

    o	New cophenetic() in "mva" as utility for hierarchical clustering.

    o	p.adjust() has two new methods, 'Hommel' and 'FDR', contributed
	by Gordon Smyth <smyth at wehi.edu.au>.

    o	stars() now has add and plot arguments.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The assignment operator `_' is deprecated: a warning is	given
	once per R session.

    o	machine() is deprecated in favour of .Platform$OS.type.
	Machine() and Platform() are deprecated in favour of .Machine
	and .Platform.

    o	arima0.diag() (package ts) is defunct.

    o	piechart() is defunct.

    o	print.ordered() has been removed, so print.factor() is used.

    o	The global internal variables .Dyn.libs and .lib.loc are
	removed in favor of the internal functions .dynLibs() and
	.libPaths().

    o	restart() is deprecated in preparation for proper exception
	handling.  Use try(), as has long been recommended.


DOCUMENTATION CHANGES

    o	New demo(persp) containing some of the former example(persp) ones
	and more.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	Rversion.h is no longer automatically included by R.h.
	Include it explicitly if you need it.

    o	New entry point R_tmpnam in Utils.h.

    o	The Unix event loop interface has been changed to facilitate
	integration with other loops. R_checkActivity and
	R_runHandlers should eventually replace getSelectedHandler.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	Perl 5.005 or newer is now required.

    o	R CMD INSTALL is now guaranteed to sort the R source files in
	ASCII order.


UTILITIES

    o	R CMD check now tests for mis-use on an installed or binary
	package, and sets 'T' and 'F' to 'NULL' when running the
	examples.

    o	New function SweaveSyntConv() converts between Sweave file
	syntaxes. RweaveLatex() now gets its prompt from options() and
	uses the text width as linebreak cutoff for deparsing input
	statements.


BUG FIXES

    o	axis() was not respecting par("mgp")[3] by default.
	(PR#916)

    o	tcltk back-compatibility fix for tcl8.0

    o	hist.POSIXct(*, breaks) now works for `breaks = #{breaks}' and
	when `x' has NAs; the latter applies to cut.POSIXct() as well.

    o	The internal download.file() methods were setting the proxy
	port to 0 unless it was specified.

    o	poly() did not work for >=3 column matrices.

    o	cut.default() was not handling infinite values with infinite
	breaks.	 (PR#1694)

    o	ks.test() could fail due to integer overflow if n.x and n.y
	were both large.

    o	all.equal(3., 3:3) wasn't TRUE when the methods package was
	present.

    o	read.table() could remap non-syntactic names to duplicates,
	and did not check for duplicated names.

    o	ls.str(envir = environment(F)) now works (when F is a function).

    o	pie() now has a `border' (and 'lty') argument which allows empty
	slice borders and makes pie() useable for hundreds of slices.

    o	all.equal.character() now works correctly also when NAs don't
	match (PR#1767).

    o	all.equal.numeric() now gives character {instead of list} when
	lengths don't match.

    o	read.dcf() had a memory leak.

    o	Setting "tcl = a" in a highlevel graphic function worked almost
	as if par(tcl = a) was called (i.e. was persistent).  Further,
	after par(tcl= <.>), highlevel graphic setting of tcl didn't work
	anymore.  "tck" has now S's default of -0.01 (when tcl=NA).

    o	data() was not checking if ./data was a directory before
	warning.

    o	Assignment beyond the end of character strings was filling
	with "", whereas changing the length extended with NA_STRING.
	Now NA_STRING is used for both.

    o	boxplot()s with logarithmic scale in "width-direction" now have
	proper widths, i.e. typically constant.

    o	Using GNU readline in asynchronous event callbacks (e.g. TclTk
	or Gtk) works correctly, i.e. doesn't cause readline to abort
	the process.

    o	Using Q to exit a browser invoked at the top-level could lead to
	the browser being invoked on all future top-level loops (PR#1721)

    o	step(fit, direction="both") now uses both directions even if
	no scope is supplied.

    o	strwidth(), strheight() now give 0 on NA strings (as they
	are no longer plotted). (PR#1739)

    o	mtext(), persp(), plot.hclust() and title() no longer plot NA
	character strings.

    o	pdf() has been protected against the user who specified
	non-existent fonts. (PR#1748)

    o	dlnorm() returns zero for negative x argument. (PR#1781)

    o	Printing 0 in octmode gave "" not "0". (PR#1759)

    o	anova.glm() was ignoring a `dispersion' argument if given
	multiple objects. (PR#1807)

    o	model.matrix() with a `rhs ~ .' formula included columns with
	duplicated names in the data frame, which caused subsequent
	confusion (e.g. in prediction from the object).

	model.matrix() was sometimes incorrectly determining the first
	factor in a formula without an intercept.

    o	termplot() now needs data= argument more rarely. (PR#828)

    o	abline() on log scale doesn't draw -ve points. (PR#1243)

    o	The Java search engine now works within Mozilla 1.0 and
	Netscape 6.2.x / 7.0pr1.

    o	unsplit() failed if f was a list of factors. (PR#1843)

    o	The methods package generic version of primitives is now "sealed"
	and cannot be redefined (it was always a bad idea to do so).

    o	quantile() gave -Inf not NaN in some examples. (Related to PR#1852)

    o	read.table() read too far in checking the file structure if
	0 < nrows < 5 and more rows existed on the file. (PR1809)

    o	loess() was not checking for too small a span (so no points
	were included in the smoothing window).

    o	match() was assuming that there was only one possible bit
	pattern for a numeric NA, so some matches failed on Solaris
	under some compiler options.

    o	identical() no longer thinks NaN and as.double(NA) are identical.

    o	pipe() can open in a binary mode even on Linux (where popen
	cannot).

    o	zero-column matrices were not being printed at all, not even
	the row names.

    o	polygon()'s `border' argument was incorrectly documented: in
	particular `border = 0' plots in background colour.

    o	delete.response() was losing the attribute set for safe
	prediction. (PR#1840)

    o	poly() was checking the degree against the number of points
	even when predicting.

    o	Comparison of a data frame and list failed due to typo. (PR#1889)

    o	dput() and dump() attempt to check if writing succeeded. (PR#1884)

    o	rep(1:2, 0) and hence array(1:2, 0) fail no longer.

    o	apply(matrix("", 3, 0), 2, length) now works.

    o	order(na.last = NA, decreasing = TRUE) now sorts in decreasing
	order.	(PR#1906)

    o	order(na.last=NA) failed if all args were of length 1 or all
	were NA. (PR#1913, 1981)

    o	source() would crash if the `keep.source = TRUE' and the input
	contained a function with a line longer than 1024 chars. (PR#1900)

	The limits on nesting of functions and on total function size
	when the source is kept are now enforced.  As (incorrectly)
	the source was always kept, this meant functions longer than
	128Kb could crash R, even in packages.

    o	lqs() and cov.rob() check that the quantile argument does not
	exceed n-1.

    o	grid() now also works with log coordinates active.

    o	plot.table(tab, xlab="X", ylab="Y") now works as expected.

    o	plot.formula(ask=FALSE) now works. (PR#1923)

    o	as.list(<logical>) now works properly. (PR#1926).

    o	The residual SSq printed from an aov() fit with weights is
	now the weighted SSq.  (PR#1930)

    o	aov() could still fail on multistrata models with very long
	Error formulae.

    o	try() could fail in BATCH use due to use of fflush(stdin).
	Only seen on Solaris. (PR#1934)

   o	title(main=list("main")) printed garbage, as did similar calls
	using quote() instead of expression() for plotmath. (PR#1939)

   o	deparse() dropped parentheses in some case where they were
	needed. (PR#1119, 1737, 1928, at least)

   o	pdf(onefile = FALSE) never incremented the file number beyond
	two.

   o	On Unix, protect against broken pipes where popen calls succeed
	even though the command does not exist (and the glibc manual
	says it should return NULL).  (PR#1959)

   o	data.frame() was allowing explicit row.names with missing
	values, but row names are required to be unique.

   o	as.character(expression) was silently truncating to 60
	characters: the help page claimed 500 which is now true.

   o	as.hclust(x) now also works (as identity) for "hclust" objects.

   o	NextMethod didn't work right in Ops.

   o	dotchart() now obeys `xlim ='.

   o	t(x) behaves when x is a (multivariate) time series. (PR#1998)

   o	parse(text=x) no longer parses from stdin if length(x) is zero

   o	binom.test() miscalculated p-value in some extreme cases

   o	get("print.ts")(1) would segfault. It's now just an error.

   o	cbind(NULL) {and similar} gave an error instead of NULL.

   o	the complex version of solve(a,b) now also works if b is a
        vector

Subject: Windows binary for R 1.6.0 on CRAN
Message-ID: <hqmppu02c9mc3bt7ekjjjvshv2iad7jjns@4ax.com>


I've just uploaded a Windows binary of R 1.6.0 to CRAN.  It should be
visible at <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> within a few
hours.

See the CHANGES file for what's new in this version,  Most importantly
for downloaders is that the main file to download is now called
rw1060.exe.  (This file was called SetupR.exe in previous releases.)
The series of rw*.zip files is no longer being distributed.  The
mini-R files are as before, though the number of them has grown by
one.

Subject: ape 0.2 is on CRAN
Message-ID: <3.0.32.20021004135200.00909410@162.38.183.200>


A new version of ape (Analysis of Phylogenetics and Evolution) is on CRAN.

>From the Changes file:


		CHANGES IN APE VERSION 0.2


NEW FEATURES

    o The function write.tree() writes phylogenetic trees (objects of class
      "phylo") in an ASCII file using the Newick parenthetic format.

    o The function birthdeath() fits a birth-death model to branching times
      by maximum likelihood, and estimates the corresponding speciation and
      extinction rates.

    o The function scale.bar() adds a scale bar to a plot of a phylogenetic
      tree.

    o The function is.binary.tree() tests whether a phylogeny is binary.

    o Two generic functions, coalescent.intervals() and collapsed.intervals(),
      as well as some methods are introduced.

    o Several functions, including some generics and methods, for computing
      skyline plot estimates (classic and generalized) of effective
      population size through time are introduced and replace the function
      skyline.plot() in version 0.1.

    o Two data sets are now included: the phylogenetic relationships among
      the families of birds from Sibley and Ahlquist (1990), and an
      estimated clock-like phylogeny of HIV sequences sampled in the
      Democratic Republic of Congo.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o The function skyline.plot() in ape 0.1 has been deprecated and
      replaced by more elaborate functions (see above).


BUG FIXES

    o Two important bugs were fixed in plot.phylo(): phylogenies with
      multichotomies not at the root or not with only terminal branches,
      and phylogenies with a single node (i.e. only terminal branches)
      did not plot. These trees should be plotted correctly now.

    o Several bugs were fixed in diversi.time() in the computation of
      AICs and LRTs.

    o Various errors were corrected in the help pages.

Subject: R2HTML package for R 1.6
Message-ID: <5.1.1.5.2.20021015180429.00b9a4d0@stat4ux.stat.ucl.ac.be>



Hello R communauty,

I have submitted to CRAN the package R2HTML.

The purpose of this package is twice:

- provide base HTML exportation functions. Basically, you will use them 
exactly as a print function (or a cat(...file=)). Thus, making dynamic HTML 
reports is possible.

- making live HTML output with frames and command, which is very usefull 
for teaching purpose, as the student can keep a trace of his session, 
graphs beeing included as pictures.

I am afraid the doc. is not very fine, but don't hesitate to ask me any 
question about the use of this package.

Eric Lecoutre

PS: as most of R users, I am a statistician who has an empirical knowledge 
of informatic (and programmation). The code of R2HTML is certainly not the 
most efficient. In particular, I would ba happy to benefit of a real 
programmer's experience to improve the exportation of lists objects.

Subject: New package: rgenoud

We would like to announce the availability on CRAN of a new package:
R-GENetic Optimization Using Derivatives (RGENOUD).  Although RGENOUD
is new to CRAN, it has been used for a couple of years both by our
research group and others.  The current version is 1.19.

DESCRIPTION:
Package: rgenoud

INDEX:
genoud                  GENetic Optimization Using Derivatives 


GENOUD is a function that combines evolutionary algorithm methods with
a derivative-based, quasi-Newton method to solve difficult
unconstrained optimization problems.  GENOUD is made to solve problems
that are nonlinear or perhaps even discontinuous in the parameters of
the function to be optimized.  When a statistical model's estimating
function (for example, a log-likelihood) is nonlinear in the model's
parameters, the function to be optimized will usually not be globally
concave and may contain irregularities such as saddlepoints or
discontinuous jumps.  Optimization methods that rely on derivatives of
the objective function may be unable to find any optimum at all.
Multiple local optima may exist, so that there is no guarantee that a
derivative-based method will converge to the global optimum.  On the
other hand, algorithms that do not use derivative information (such as
pure GAs) are for many problems needlessly poor at local hill
climbing.  Most statistical problems are regular in the neighborhood
of the solution.  Therefore, for some portion of the search space
derivative information is useful.

Subject: RArcInfo 0.4 released
Message-ID: <7847983431virgil@uv.es>


Hi,

A new release of RArcInfo is out. The new features are:

- Two new functions to import from/to E00 files to/from binray 
coverages, which means that now it is possible to import E00 files
if they are previosly converted to a binary coverage.

- Minor changes in read.coverage

- New function 'thinlines' to reduce the number of points in the arcs 
according to the resolution we are interested in.

Besides, there is a new website: 
http://matheron.uv.es/~virgil/Rpackages/RArcInfo

There you can find useful information about RArcInfo, free data, 
interesting links, etc. In a few weeks I will release a tutorial, 
with examples based on free available data.

Comments are welcome.

Regards,


Virgilio

Subject: RPMS of R for Red Hat 8.0
Message-ID: <1035805364.993.100.camel@xena>


A binary RPM package of R 1.6.0 for Red Hat 8.0 should now be available
on a CRAN mirror near you. I apologize for the delay, but it took some
time to get a copy of the new Red Hat release.

I shall continue to support Red Hat 7.x.

For the security conscious: in order to check the GPG signature on this
package, you must first import my public key (1024D/97D3544E) into the
RPM database. See the man page for rpm. This is a change from previous
releases of Red Hat.

Subject: updated package "strucchange" 1.0-0
Message-ID: <3DBE5CA2.B83B9FF5@ci.tuwien.ac.at>


Dear R users,

the version 1.0-0 of the package `strucchange' for testing for
structural
change in linear regression relationships is now available on CRAN.
The most important new feature is functionality for dating breaks, i.e.,
estimating breakpoints in regression relationships. Thus, the package
now
contains methods for testing, dating and monitoring structural changes.
More precisely, the following features have been added:
  o simultanous estimation of breakpoints by OLS and methods for
    visualizing these and their confidence intervals
  o tcltk-based demos for testing and monitoring structural
    changes: demo(tktesting), demo(tkmonitoring)
  o new datasets:
      German M1 money demand,
      U.S. labor productivity,
      demographic data about marriages and illegitimate births
      in Grossarl, Austria
  o range versions of the OLS-based CUSUM and MOSUM test,
    alternative boundaries for RE test.
  o a function for computing the recursive residuals of a linear
    model is now available.
The DESCRIPTION of the package is given below.
Best wishes,
Achim Zeileis


Package: strucchange
Version: 1.0-0
Date: 2002-10-28
Title: Testing for Structural Change
Author: Achim Zeileis, Friedrich Leisch, Bruce Hansen,
        Kurt Hornik, Christian Kleiber, Andrea Peters
Maintainer: Achim Zeileis <zeileis at ci.tuwien.ac.at>
Description: Testing, dating and monitoring of structural change in
             linear regression relationships.
             strucchange features tests/methods from the generalized
             fluctuation test framework as well as from the F test (Chow
             test) framework. This includes methods to fit, plot and
test
             fluctuation processes (e.g., CUSUM, MOSUM, recursive/moving
             estimates) and F statistics, respectively.
             It is possible to monitor incoming data online using
             fluctuation processes.
             Finally, the breakpoints in regression models with
structural
             changes can be estimated together with confidence
intervals.
             Emphasis is always given to methods for visualizing the
data.

Subject: updated package "lmtest" 0.9-2
Message-ID: <3DBE5C32.A191C0AA@ci.tuwien.ac.at>


Dear R users,

there is a new version of the package `lmtest' for testing linear
regression models on CRAN. Except for a couple of minor bug fixes,
there are essentially these new features:
  o added Breusch-Godfrey test for serial correlation
    (thanks to David M. Mitchell who provided the initial version
     of the code for bgtest)
  o new data sets:
    mandible measurements in fetuses,
    US macroecnomic time series
  o the Durbin-Watson test dwtest() now takes an alternative
    argument. The default is to test for positive autocorrelation
    (which was the only option before).
  o a vignette, which describes the package. This is a version of an
    article that will be published in the forthcoming R News 2(3).
The DESCRIPTION of the package is given below.
Best wishes,
Achim Zeileis

Subject: new package CGIwithR
Message-ID: <559E2EC2-EB30-11D6-8AFF-0050E4C03977@nuffield.oxford.ac.uk>


A package "CGIwithR" is now available at CRAN.  It
is designed to allow R to be used as a CGI scripting
language on Unix-like systems (including Mac OS X with
the Darwin installation of R).

Why bother?  Well, CGIwithR is provided in case there are others
like myself who either
   (i) wish to provide a special-purpose calculator on the web
       which uses R for its computation
or
  (ii) wish to collect/process information via web forms,
       but don't want to learn a new language such as Perl

A user manual is provided with the package (as well as the
standard R help pages).

CGIwithR has not been tested on systems other than my own,
so I would very much welcome reports on any successes or
failures with it.

If someone wants to port it to Windows...

Subject: RODBC update
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0210301407280.7335-100000@gannet.stats>


There is a new version of RODBC, 0.9-1, with a new maintainer (me)
now on CRAN (Vienna) which works with R 1.6.x.  The Windows binary
will be there tomorrow, and both will then propagate around CRAN.

This has been tested on Linux under unixODBC against MySQL and Postgresql
(thanks to Dirk Edelbuettel), and on Windows against Access, MySQL and
Excel.  The CRAN compilation checks were against iODBC.

I had to make quite a lot of internal changes, so would appreciate
success/problem reports for other uses.

There are several improvements in this version, some of which I had
previously submitted to Michael Lapsley: see the ChangeLog.  I am
moving towards a 1.0 release which will be somewhat incompatible
(`channel' will be a classed object and quoting names will be
essential to allow them to be passed as R variables, for example).

In the longer term the planned DBI/ODBC interface may replace RODBC
entirely via a back-compatibility wrapper.

Message-ID: <D7A3CFD7825BD6119B880002A58F06C20149D161@groexmb02.pfizer.com>



Version 0.7.3 of the gregmisc package is now available on CRAN.  A compiled
windows package has also been sent to Brian Ripley for inclusion in the
windows package directory.

This version of gregmisc fixes a number of bugs and introduces several new
functions.

Highlights of this version:
===========================

New Features:
- Introduction of pdirichlet() and rdirichlet() functions.
- Addition of fast.prcomp() and fast.svd(), are more efficient than 
  the built-in versions on very wide matrixes.  (Short term solution 
  until patches are integrated into the R source.)
- Add permute() function as a convenience wrapper for sample()

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed bug in barplot2() when log scale axes are used.
- Fixed contrasts.lm() to allow use on aov objects
- Other miscellaneous bug fixes.
- Removed enhanced version of plot.lm() which has been broken by
  recent changes to R base packages.  

Documentation Enhancements:
- make.contrasts(), which allows easy creation of user specified
  contrasts, is now fully documented.
- Help files for make.contrasts and contrast.lm now show how to
  compute and test contrasts, including SSQ decompositions, in
  analysis of variance models

Subject: R-1.6.1 is released
Message-ID: <x23cql1pq5.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>


I've rolled up R-1.6.1.tgz a short while ago. This is a minor upgrade,
fixing an assortment of minor bugs, and one major one: 1.6.0
introduced a memory leak in deparsing, causing much trouble for people
running simulations.

You can get it from the developer site at

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.6.1.tgz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. Binaries for
various platforms will appear in due course.
 
There is also a version split for floppies, but due to the inclusion
of recommended packages as binary .tar.gz files, I'm no longer
providing a patch file.


        For the R Core Team,

        Peter D.


Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:


                CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.6.1


NEW FEATURES

    o   Added a few "trivial and obviously missing" functions to tcltk:
        tkchooseDirectory, tkpopup, tkdialog, tkread

    o   barplot() has a new argument `axis.lty', which if set to 1
        allows the pre-1.6.0 behaviour of plotting the axis and tick
        marks for the categorical axis.  (This was apparently not
        intentional, but axis() used to ignore lty=0.)
        The argument `border' is no longer ".NotYetUsed".


BUG FIXES

    o   hist(<datetime>, cex.axis = f)  now works for x-axis too.

    o   prompt() gave wrong \usage{.} for long argument default expressions.

    o   summary(x) gives more information when `x' is a logical
        (or a data frame with a logical column which is now quite customary).

    o   seq.POSIXt(from, to, length.out= . ) could give too long results

    o   summaryRprof() was counting nested calls to the same function
        twice.

    o   Printing of objects of mode "expression" did strange things if
        there were "%" characters in the deparsed expression (PR#2120).

    o   as.matrix.data.frame converted missings to "NA" not character NA.
        (PR#2130)

    o   spec.pgram() was only interpolating zero freq for one series. (PR#2123)

    o   help(randu) had % unescaped in the example. (PR#2141)

    o   Making html links would fail if packages-head.html was not
        writeable. (PR#2133)

    o   Sweave.sty was not installed to $R_HOME/share/texmf when
        builddir != srcdir. On Windows backslashes in latex paths have
        to be replaced by slashes.

    o   A memory leak in deparsing was introduced when eliminating
        static variables (thanks to Achim Zeileis for spotting this).
        A similar problem in loading workspaces has been corrected.

    o   TclInterface.Rd incorrectly used \synopsis for \usage so that
        the usage section wasn't output.

    o   Readline stack off-by-one error. (PR#2165)

    o   R_ExpandFileName had a memory leak in the case libreadline was
        used under Unix-alikes.

    o   sys.save.image() now closes all connections so it will work even
        if the connection list has become full.

    o   loess() had an unstated limit of four predictors: this is now
        documented and enforced.

    o   ${R_HOME}/etc/Renviron.site is now not read if R_ENVIRON is
        set, as documented.  Previously it was read unless R_ENVIRON
        pointed to an actual file.

    o   Startup.Rd described the proceesing under Unix-alikes but
        incorrectly implied it happened that way on the Windows and
        MacOS ports.  Neither use Renviron.site, for example.

    o   besselK(x,*) now returns 0 instead of Inf for large x. (PR#2179)

    o   The Tcl console code didn't work with Tcl/TK 8.0, and has been
        #ifdef'd out.  (PR#2090)

    o   format.AsIs() was not handling matrices.

    o   sd() was not passing na.rm to var() for matrices and data frames.

    o   dist() {mva} silently treated +/-Inf as NA.

    o   setwd() now returns NULL invisibly.

    o   basename() and dirname() did not check the length of their
        input and ignored elements after the first.  This affected
        undoc {tools}.

    o   If A had dimnames, eigen(A) had inappropriate dimnames. (PR#2116)

    o   as.POSIXct.dates had a sign error for the origin (PR#2222)

    o   The claim that pie charts should be avoiden (in pie.Rd) is now
        supported by a quote from Cleveland (1985).

    o   The vsnprintf() functions supplied for systems that don't
        supply their own had a bug in the output of fractional parts,
        corrupting data if using save() with ascii=TRUE. (PR#2144)

    o   pretty() values close to 0 in some cases which are now 0 (PR#1032
        and D.Brahm's mails).


BUILD ISSUES

    o   Toplevel Makefile was missing dependency of "docs" on "R" (causing
        parallel makes to go wrong)

    o   When building with recommended packages those were installed
        into the first path in R_LIBS, if the environment variable was
        present.

Subject: Windows binary for R 1.6.1 on CRAN
Message-ID: <gmifsusbvh1jufjlpjfnajvteioo7kqdih@4ax.com>


I've just uploaded a Windows binary of R 1.6.1 to CRAN.  It should be
visible at <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> by tomorrow,
and will hopefully show up on the mirrors around the same time.

Besides the (mostly bug fix) changes in all versions of R, this
Windows version contains the following changes:

 - Changed titles on help windows so topic name shows when minimized.

 - Dependencies were not being generated properly in packages using
C++.

 - share/R/firstlib.R was not being included in the binary
distribution.

Important for downloaders:  the main file to download is called
rw1061.exe.  (This file was called SetupR.exe before 1.6.0.) The
series of rw*.zip files is no longer being distributed.  The mini-R
files are as before.

Subject: Windows binary for R 1.6.1 FIXED
Message-ID: <8m6osu0kg1ic63fheksu8pvtmmpe4it77g@4ax.com>


To Windows R users:

The binary build of R that I uploaded on Tuesday contained errors in
the compiled HTML help files and some of the PDF versions of the
manuals.  In particular, the index was missing from the CHM files, and
the table of contents was missing from at least one of the manuals.

I've since found the error in my setup, and have rebuilt the
distribution.  I uploaded it to CRAN this afternoon; it will likely
propagate to all of the mirrors over the weekend.

Before you download it, please make sure that you see the note on the
download page about the correction (otherwise you may be downloading
the original version).

The URL is <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base>.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience that this has caused.

Subject: New package: msm for multi-state models
Message-ID: <3DCF9D8A.60509@ic.ac.uk>


Dear R users,

A new package "msm", for multi-state modelling, is now available on CRAN.  
It can be used to fit continuous-time Markov models to irregularly-observed
categorical processes.  These models are typically used for the 
progression of
chronic diseases, where a patient visits a doctor at irregular intervals 
and is
diagnosed as being in one of a set of disease stages. The transition rates
of the Markov process can be modelled as a function of covariates, and 
the models
are estimated by maximum likelihood.

The software can also fit a form of hidden Markov model: a multi-state
model in which the stages are observed with misclassification.  These 
might be
used in cases where a disease screening test is subject to false 
positives or negatives.
The probabilities of misclassification and the Markov chain transition 
rates can then
be estimated simultaneously, by maximum likelihood.  Covariates can be 
fitted to
both the transition rates and the misclassification probabilities.

Bug reports, reports of successes or failures, and suggestions for 
improvement are
welcome. We would also be interested to hear what applications people 
might be
interested in using this package for.

Subject: New version of rgenoud
Message-ID: <15824.23762.26065.934271@musil.localdomain>



We would like to announce the availability of a new version of our
R-GENetic Optimization Using Derivatives (RGENOUD) package.  The new
version is 1.20.

Source code along with LINUX, Windows, and MacOS binaries are
available on CRAN and at http://jsekhon.fas.harvard.edu/rgenoud/.


DESCRIPTION:
Package: rgenoud
Version: 1.20
Date: 2002-11-05
Title: R version of GENetic Optimization Using Derivatives
Author: Walter R. Mebane, Jr. <wrm1 at cornell.edu>,
 Jasjeet Singh Sekhon <jasjeet_sekhon at harvard.edu> 
Maintainer: Jasjeet Singh Sekhon <jasjeet_sekhon at harvard.edu>
Depends: R (>= 1.6.0)
Description: A genetic algorithm plus derivative optimizer
License: GPL version 2 or newer
URL: http://jsekhon.fas.harvard.edu/rgenoud/


GENOUD is a function that combines evolutionary algorithm methods with
a derivative-based, quasi-Newton method to solve difficult
unconstrained optimization problems.  GENOUD is made to solve problems
that are nonlinear or perhaps even discontinuous in the parameters of
the function to be optimized.  When a statistical model's estimating
function (for example, a log-likelihood) is nonlinear in the model's
parameters, the function to be optimized will usually not be globally
concave and may contain irregularities such as saddlepoints or
discontinuous jumps.  Optimization methods that rely on derivatives of
the objective function may be unable to find any optimum at all.
Multiple local optima may exist, so that there is no guarantee that a
derivative-based method will converge to the global optimum.  On the
other hand, algorithms that do not use derivative information (such as
pure GAs) are for many problems needlessly poor at local hill
climbing.  Most statistical problems are regular in the neighborhood
of the solution.  Therefore, for some portion of the search space
derivative information is useful.

CHANGES from v1.19:
1) A memory error related to long running processes using MemoryMatrix
has been corrected.
2) An erroneous warning which was issued when the number of parameters
was larger than 25 has been corrected.

For more information please visit

We look forward to receiving questions, comments and suggestions.

Subject: Using XEmacs and ESS with R for MS/Windows
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20021124091444.01dc6318@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>


I've been working on a document describing the use of XEmacs and ESS with R 
for Windows users, along with configuration files that are meant to make 
things simple for Windows users. This was initially intended for my 
students, but with recent discussions of Windows (and other) editors on the 
the R-help list, I thought that I'd make the material more widely available.

The document describes how to install, configure, and use XEmacs and ESS 
with R under Windows. The configuration files divide the XEmacs windows 
into two sub-windows, one for R source files (with tabs when multiple files 
are open), the other with the R process. A customized toolbar is provided 
with buttons to send individual lines, "paragraphs," marked regions of 
text, and functions from the source window to the R process; there are 
other buttons to source the whole file silently, and to interrupt the R 
process. Menus are provided to perform operations similar to those in the 
standard Windows R GUI -- for example, to install, load, and update 
packages. In general, I've tried to provide features available in the R GUI 
and in Uwe Ligges's R plug-in for the shareware editor WinEdt. As well, 
I've attempted to make XEmacs appear more Windows-like in its behaviour, 
for example by defining standard Windows editing keys.

More information is available at 
<http://www.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/ESS/>.

Comments and suggestions would be appreciated.

I have moved the R-announce mailing list from the Majordomo
software to a combination of procmail & mailman an hour or so ago.
You find a link in the footer of this message giving an URL
where you can modify your subscription, look at the archives
(everything from the beginning in 1997) and more.

CHANGE:  Postings to R-announce are now moderated, ie.
	 they have to be approved by a list maintainer
	 unless they come from one of a small set of R developers.

Note that *everyone* subscribed to R-help also gets R-announce
messages without a need to subscribe.

Notice that the "Sender:" field of these e-mails has changed
from owner-r-announce to r-announce-admin. Those who use
mail-filtering rules may wish to adapt. 

We expect faster mail delivery and an easier user (and
maintainer!) interface.  Feedback welcome, to me privately or R-help.

The R-help mailing list (and its "digest") version will move to
mailman too.

Subject: Apology for mail loop with move of R-announce
In-Reply-To: <15843.45537.990567.20509@gargle.gargle.HOWL>
References: <15843.45537.990567.20509@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

Dear readers of R-announce and R-help.
Yesterday, I sent a message with
   Subject: R-announce moved from majordomo to [procmail+mailman]
on Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2002 18:39:45 +0100
to R-announce and hence R-help.

Many of you will have received the message several times,
typically from half a dozen to about 25x.
I do apologize for this.  
The reason was the automatic gateway ("forwarding") of all
R-announce messages to R-help that accidentally produced a mail
loop.  I only found out relatively late (~ 20 min after
sending), and had to stop delivery entirely for which several of
you probably haven't received that message at all.

The new web interface to the list is now available at
    https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce
and particularly the __archive__ contains yesterday's message
as https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2002/000362.html
(and yes, you should accept the security certificate _once_).

Again with apologies and regards,

Subject: R genetics package now available
Message-ID: <D7A3CFD7825BD6119B880002A58F06C202F2C30D@groexmb02.pfizer.com>

The "genetics" package for handling single-locus genetic data is now
available on CRAN in both source and Windows binary formats.  The purpose of
this package is to  make it easy to create and manipulate genetic
information, and to facility use of this information in statistical models.


The library includes classes and methods for creating, representing, and
manipulating genotypes (unordered allele pairs) and haplotypes (ordered
allele pairs).  Genotypes and
haplotypes can be annotated with chromosome, locus, gene, and marker
information. Utility functions compute genotype and allele frequencies, flag
homozygotes or heterozygotes, flag allele carriers
of certain alleles, count the number of a specific allele carried by an
individual, extract one or both alleles, estimate and generate confidence
intervals for measures of single-marker disequlibrium, and test for
departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

The package description file and a simple example are appended below.
Comments and contributions are, of course, welcome.

-Greg

Message-ID: <MABBLJDICACNFOLGIHJOAEGBDBAA.philippe.grosjean@ifremer.fr>

We would like to announce the existence of a Special Interest Group in GUI
development for R (R-SIG-GUI). This mailing list discusses issues concerning
the development of graphical user interfaces for R, especially platform
independent ones. It is a complementary tool to the R GUI web pages
(http://www.r-project.org/GUI) that exist since July 2002.
Best Regards,

Philippe Grosjean

Subject: Initial release of RSOAP - a simple interface to R via SOAP
Message-ID: <D7A3CFD7825BD6119B880002A58F06C202F2C330@groexmb02.pfizer.com>

Announcing the initial public release of RSOAP at
http://software.biostat.washington.edu/statsoft/snake/RSOAP.

Description:	

RSOAP provides a SOAP interface for the open-source statistical 
package R. It permits software to take advantage of the advanced 
statistical analysis techniques provided by R---running either 
locally or on a remote machine---using the simple and widely 
accepted SOAP protocol. 

RSOAP provides a simple API for managing and communicating with 
multiple concurrent R processes. Using SOAP as the communications 
protocol avoids direct handling of binary data while preserving 
the underlying data structures, and makes R easily accessible 
from a variety of applications and programming languages. 

Availability:

More information and the source code for RSOAP is available at 
http://software.biostat.washington.edu/statsoft/snake/RSOAP/manage.

Subject: New package : ade4
Message-ID: <f05200f01ba1dfd95a341@[134.214.32.58]>

Hello,

The ade4 package is now available on CRAN.

ade4 is a multivariate data analysis package oriented towards statistical
ecology. The main functions include one-table (PCA, COA, MCA, PCO, etc.),
two-tables (PCAIV, Co-inertia, CCA, etc.) and k-tables multivariate analysis
methods, with several Monte-Carlo tests and many graphical display methods.
A complete documentation with many example data sets is also available.

Most of these methods and data sets come from statistical ecology, but
the statistical methods can of course be used in many other fields.

The ade4 package is a port of the ADE4 software to R. The ADE4 software
is also free and available on Internet, and it has its own web server and
mailing list :

Subject: new package "vcd" 0.1-3
Message-ID: <3DFDA500.384A8908@ci.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear R users,

there is a new package on CRAN called `vcd' for visualizing categorical
data. It basically implements a set of visualization techniques together
with a large collection of data sets and examples from the book
"Visualizing Categorical Data" by Michael Friendly. By now the features
of the package essentially cover chapters 2-4 from the book:
  o fitting and graphing discrete distributions:
    goodness-of-fit tests for poisson, binomial and negative binomial
    distribution; rootograms; Ord plots; poissonness plots.
  o 2-way contingency tables:
    improved fourfold displays (compared to base); trilinear plots;
    sieve diagrams, agreement charts.
  o mosaic displays for n-way tables:
    improved mosaicplots (compared to base); mosaic matrices.
We work on extensions enhancing several functions so this is very much
work-in-progress, but we wanted to provide a first version which already
offers a lot of functionality. Furthermore we intend to implement
further visualization tools for categorical data, in particular for
loglinear models.
The DESCRIPTION of the package is given below.
Best wishes,
Achim Zeileis


Package: vcd
Version: 0.1-3
Date: 2002-11-22
Title: Visualizing Categorical Data
Author: David Meyer, Achim Zeileis, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Kurt Hornik
Maintainer: Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik at R-project.org>
Description: Functions and data sets based on the book "Visualizing
             Categorical Data" by Michael Friendly.
