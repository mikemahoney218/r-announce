Subject: R Participation in the Google Summer of Code 2010
Message-ID: <19368.55659.435905.884614@ron.nulle.part>


Dear R Users,

We would like to highlight that R has once again been selected to participate
in the Google Summer of Code.  Suggested projects can be found in the R-Wiki:
http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:projects:gsoc2010.  The GSoC
is a program from Google that offers student developers stipends to write
code for various open source software projects (more information can be found
here: http://code.google.com/soc/).

All discussion related to R and the Google Summer of Code should preferably
tak place on the respective google group:
http://groups.google.com/group/gsoc-r (gsoc-r at googlegroups.com).
 
We are currently in a time period during which interested students can
discuss an idea from the wiki with the respective project mentor, or contact
the gsoc-r group to propose a new one and find a mentor.  Please note that
some projects on the R-Wiki also provide test questions, so please read these
pages thoroughly before contacting a project mentor. The student application
period opens on March 29th.

Best regards,

the R Project GSoC mentors

Subject: R 2.11.0 is released
Message-ID: <48FC08AE-CFDC-41D0-A9A0-A462CF4E831A@cbs.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.11.0.tar.gz a short while ago. This is a development
release which contains a number of new features.

Also, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list
of changes below.

NOTE: The build platform has been changed for this release. Please watch out extra carefully for anomalies.

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.11.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.11.0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o   Packages must have been installed under R >= 2.10.0, as the
        current help system is the only one now supported.

    o   A port to 64-bit Windows is now available as well as binary
        package repositiories: see the 'R Administration and
        Installation Manual'.

    o   Argument matching for primitive functions is now done in the
        same way as for interpreted functions except for the deliberate
        exceptions

            call switch .C .Fortran .Call .External

        all of which use positional matching for their first argument,
        and also some internal-use-only primitives.

    o   The default device for command-line R at the console on Mac OS X
        is now quartz() and not X11().


NEW FEATURES

    o   The 'open' modes for connections are now interpreted more
        consistently.  open = "r" is now equivalent to open = "rt" for
        all connections.  The default open = "" now means "rt" for all
        connections except the compressed file connections gzfile(),
        bzfile() and xzfile() for which it means "rb".

    o   R CMD INSTALL now uses the internal untar() in package utils:
        this ensures that all platforms can install bzip2- and
        xz-compressed tarballs.  In case this causes problems (as it
        has on some Windows file systems when run from Cygwin tools)
        it can be overridden by the environment variable
        R_INSTALL_TAR: setting this to a modern external tar program
        will speed up unpacking of large (tens of Mb or more)
        tarballs.

    o   help(try.all.packages = TRUE) is much faster (although the
        time taken by the OS to find all the packages the first time
        it is used can dominate the time).

    o   R CMD check has a new option '--timings' to record
        per-example timings in file <pkg>.Rcheck/<pkg>-Ex.timings.

    o   The TRE library has been updated to version 0.8.0 (minor bugfixes).

    o   grep[l], [g]sub and [g]regexpr now work in bytes in an 8-bit
        locales if there is no marked UTF-8 input string: this will be
        somewhat faster, and for [g]sub() give the result in the
        native encoding rather than in UTF-8 (which returns to the
        behaviour prior to R 2.10.0).

    o   A new argument 'skipCalls' has been added to browser() so that
        it can report the original context when called by other
        debugging functions.

    o   More validity checking of UTF-8 and MBCS strings is done by
        agrep() and the regular-expression matching functions.

    o   The undocumented restriction on gregexpr() to length(text) > 0
        has been removed.

    o   Package tcltk now sends strings to Tcl in UTF-8: this means
        that strings with a marked UTF-8 encoding are supported in
        non-UTF-8 locales.

    o   The graphics engine now supports rendering of raster (bitmap)
        images, though not all graphics devices can provide (full)
        support.  Packages providing graphics devices (e.g., Cairo,
        RSvgDevice, cairoDevice) will need to be reinstalled.

        There is also support in the graphics engine for capturing
        raster images from graphics devices (again not supported
        on all graphics devices).

    o   R CMD check now also checks if the package and namespace can
        be unloaded: this provides a check of the .Last.lib() and
        .onUnload() hook functions (unless --install=fake).

    o   prop.table(x) now accepts a one-dimensional table for x.

    o   A new function vapply() has been added, based on a suggestion
        from Bill Dunlap.  It requires that a template for the
        function value be specified, and uses it to determine the
        output type and to check for consistency in the function
        values.

    o   The main HTML help page now links to a reformatted copy of
        this NEWS file. (Suggested by Henrik Bengtsson.)  Package
        index files link to the package DESCRIPTION and NEWS files and
        a list of demos when using dynamic help.

    o   The [ method for class "AsIs" allows the next method to change
        the underlying class.  (Wish of Jens Oehlschl?gel.)

    o   write.csv[2] no longer allow 'append' to be changed: as ever,
        direct calls to write.table() give more flexibility as well as
        more room for error.

    o   The index page for HTML help for a package now collapses
        multiple signatures for S4 methods into a single entry.

    o   The use of '.required' by require() and detach() has been
        replaced by '.Depends' which is set from the 'Depends' field
        of a package (even in packages with name spaces).  By default
        detach() prevents such dependencies from being detached: this
        can be overridden by the argument 'force'.

    o   bquote() has been extended to work on function definitions
        (wish of PR#14031).

    o   detach() when applied to an object other than a package
        returns the environment that has been detached, to parallel
        attach().

    o   readline() in non-interactive use returns "" and does not
        attempt to read from the 'terminal'.

    o   New function file_ext() in package 'tools'.

    o   xtfrm() is now primitive and internally generic, as this allows
        S4 methods to be set on it without name-space scoping issues.

        There are now "AsIs" and "difftime" methods, and the default
        method uses unclass(x) if is.numeric(x) is true (which will be
        faster but relies on is.numeric() having been set correctly
        for the class).

    o   is.numeric(x) is now false for a "difftime" object
        (multiplication and division make no sense for such objects).

    o   The default method of weighted.mean(x, w) coerces 'w' to be
        numeric (aka double); previously only integer weights were
        coerced.  Zero weights are handled specially so an infinite
        value with zero weight does not force an NaN result.

        There is now a "difftime" method.

    o   bug.report() now has 'package' and 'lib.loc' arguments to
        generate bug reports about packages.  When this is used, it
        looks for a BugReports field in the package DESCRIPTION file,
        which will be assumed to be a URL at which to submit the
        report, and otherwise generates an email to the package
        maintainer.  (Suggested by Barry Rowlingson.)

    o   quantile() now has a method for the date-time class "POSIXt",
        and types 1 and 3 (which never interpolate) work for Dates and
        ordered factors.

    o   length(<POSIXlt>)  now returns the length of the corresponding
        abstract timedate-vector rather than always 9 (the length of the
        underlying list structure).  (Wish of PR#14073 and PR#10507.)

    o   The readline completion backend no longer sorts possible
        completions alphabetically (e.g., function argument names) if
        R was built with readline >= 6.

    o   select.list() gains a 'graphics' argument to allow Windows/Mac
        users to choose the text interface.  This changes the
        behaviour of new.packages(ask=TRUE) to be like
        update.packages(ask=TRUE) on those platforms in using a text
        menu: use ask="graphics" for a graphical menu.

    o   New function chooseBioCmirror() to set the "BioC_mirror" option.

    o   The R grammar prevents using the argument 'name' in signatures
        of S4 methods for '$' and '$<-', since they will always be
        called with a character string value for 'name'.  The implicit
        S4 generic functions have been changed to reflect this:
        packages which included 'name' in the signature of their
        methods need to be updated and re-installed.

    o   The handling of the 'method' argument of glm() has been
        refined following suggestions by Ioannis Kosmidis and Heather
        Turner.

    o   str() gains a new argument 'list.len' with default 99, limiting the
        number of list() items (per level), thanks to suggestions from
        David Winsenius.

    o   Having formal arguments of an S4 method in a different order
        from the generic is now an error (the warning having been
        ignored by some package maintainers for a long time).

    o   New functions enc2native() and enc2utf8() convert character
        vectors with possibly marked encodings to the current locale and
        UTF-8 respectively.

    o   Unrecognized escapes and embedded nuls in character strings are
        now an error, not just a warning.  Thus option "warnEscapes"
        is no longer needed.  rawToChar() now removes trailing nuls
        silently, but other embedded nuls become errors.

    o   Informational messages about masked objects displayed when a
        package is attached are now more compact, using strwrap()
        instead of one object per line.

    o   print.rle() gains argument 'prefix'.

    o   download.file() gains a "curl" method, mainly for use on
        platforms which have 'curl' but not 'wget', but also for some
        hard-to-access URLs.

    o   In Rd, \eqn and \deqn will render in HTML (and convert to text)
        upper- and lower-case Greek letters (entered as \alpha ...),
        \ldots, \dots, \ge and \le.

    o   utf8ToInt() and intToUtf8() now map NA inputs to NA outputs.

    o   file() has a new argument 'raw' which may help if it is used
        with something other than a regular file, e.g. a character device.

    o   New function strtoi(), a wrapper for the C function strtol.

    o   as.octmode() and as.hexmode() now allow inputs of length other
        than one.

        The format() and print() methods for "octmode" now preserve
        names and dimensions (as those for "hexmode" did).

        The format() methods for classes "octmode" and "hexmode" gain
        a 'width' argument.

    o   seq.int() returns an integer result in some further cases
        where seq() does, e.g. seq.int(1L, 9L, by = 2L).

    o   Added \subsection{}{} macro to Rd syntax, for subsections
        within sections.

    o   n-dimensional arrays with dimension names can now be indexed
        by an n-column character matrix. The indices are matched
        against the dimension names.  NA indices are propagated to the
        result.  Unmatched values and "" are not allowed and result in
        an error.

    o   interaction(drop=TRUE) uses less memory (related to PR#14121).

    o   summary() methods have been added to the "srcref" and
        "srcfile" classes, and various encoding issues have been
        cleaned up.

    o   If option "checkPackageLicense" is set to TRUE (not currently
        the default), users will be asked to agree to
        non-known-to-be-FOSS package licences at first use.

    o   Checking setAs(a,b) methods only gives a message instead of a
        warning, when one of a or b is unknown.

    o   New function norm() to compute a matrix norm.
        norm() and also backsolve() and sample() have implicit S4 generics.

    o   Renviron.site and Rprofile.site can have architecture-specific
        versions on systems with sub-architectures.

    o   R CMD check now (by default) also checks Rd files for
        auto-generated content in need of editing, and missing argument
        descriptions.

    o   aggregate() gains a formula method thanks to a contribution by
        Arni Magnusson.  The data frame method now allows summary
        functions to return arbitrarily many values.

    o   path.expand() now propagates NA values rather than converting them
        to "NA".

    o   file.show() now disallows NA values for file names, headers, and
        pager.

    o   The 'fuzz' used by seq() and seq.int() has been reduced from
        1e-7 to 1e-10, which should be ample for the double-precision
        calculations used in R.  It ensures that the fuzz never comes
        into play with sequences of integers (wish of PR#14169).

    o   The default value of RSiteSearch(restrict=) has been changed
        to include vignettes but to exclude R-help.  The R-help
        archives available have been split, with a new option of
        "Rhelp10" for those from 2010.

    o   New function rasterImage() in the 'graphics' package for drawing
        raster images.

    o   stats:::extractAIC.coxph() now omits aliased terms when computing
        the degrees of freedom (suggestion of Terry Therneau).

    o   cor() and cov() now test for misuse with non-numeric
        arguments, such as the non-bug report PR#14207.

    o   pchisq(ncp =, log.p = TRUE) is more accurate for probabilities
        near one.  E.g. pchisq(80, 4, ncp=1, log.p=TRUE).  (Maybe what
        was meant in PR#14126.)

    o   maintainer() has been added, to give convenient access to the
        name of the maintainer of a package (contributed by David
        Scott).

    o   sample() and sample.int() allow zero items to be sampled from
        a zero-length input.  sample.int() gains a default value
        'size=n' to be more similar to sample().

    o   switch() returned NULL on error (not previously documented on
        the help page): it now does so invisibly, analogously to
        if-without-else.

        It is now primitive: this means that EXPR is always matched to
        the first argument and there is no danger of partial matching
        to later named arguments.

    o   Primitive functions UseMethod(), attr(), attr<-(), on.exit(),
        retracemem() and substitute() now use standard argument
        matching (rather than positional matching).  This means that
        all multi-argument primitives which are not internal now use
        standard argument matching except where positional matching is
        desirable (as for switch(), call(), .C() ...).

    o   All the one-argument primitives now check that any name
        supplied for their first argument is a partial match to the
        argument name as documented on the help page: this also
        applies to replacement functions of two arguments.

    o   base::which() uses a new .Internal function when arr.ind is
        FALSE resulting in a 10x speedup.  Thanks to Patrick Aboyoun
        for implementation suggestions.

    o   Help conversion to text now uses the first part of \enc{}{}
        markup if it is representable in the current output encoding.
        On the other hand, conversion to LaTeX with the default
        outputEncoding = "ASCII" uses the second part.

    o   A new class "listOfMethods" has been introduced to represent
        the methods in a methods table, to replace the deprecated
        class "MethodsList".

    o   any() and all() return early if possible.  This may speed up
        operations on long vectors.

    o   strptime() now accepts "%z" (for the offset from UTC in the
        RFC822 format of +/-hhmm).

    o   The PCRE library has been updated to version 8.02, a bug-fix
        release which also updates tables to Unicode 5.02.

    o   Functions which may use a graphical select.list() (including
        menu() and install.packages()) now check on a Unix-alike that
        Tk can be started (and not just
        capabilities("tcltk") && capabilities("X11")).

    o   The parser no longer marks strings containing octal or hex
        escapes as being in UTF-8 when entered in a UTF-8 locale.

    o   On platforms with cairo but not Pango (notably Mac OS X) the
        initial default X11() type is set to "Xlib": this avoids
        several problems with font selection when done by cairo rather
        than Pango (at least on Mac OS X).

    o   New arrayInd() such that which(x, arr.ind = TRUE) for an array
        'x' is now equivalent to arrayInd(which(x), dim(x), dimnames(x)).


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   Bundles of packages are defunct.

    o   stats::clearNames() is defunct: use unname().

    o   Basic regular expressions are defunct, and strsplit(), grep(),
        grepl(), sub(), gsub(), regexpr() and gregexpr() no longer
        have an 'extended' argument.

    o   methods::trySilent() is defunct.

    o   index.search() (which was deprecated in 2.10.0) is no longer
        exported and has a different argument list.

    o   Use of multiple arguments to return() is now defunct.

    o   The use of UseMethod() with more than two arguments is now defunct.

    o   In the 'methods' package, the MethodsList metadata objects which
        had been superseded by hash tables (environments) since R
        2.8.0 are being phased out.  Objects of this class are no
        longer assigned or used as metadata by the package.

        getMethods() is now deprecated, with its internal use replaced
        by findMethods() and other changes.  Creating objects from the
        MethodsList class is also deprecated.

    o   Parsing strings containing both octal/hex and Unicode escapes
        now gives a warning and will become an error in R 2.12.0.


INSTALLATION

    o   UTF-8 is now used for the reference manual and package
        manuals.  This requires LaTeX '2005/12/01' or later.

    o   configure looks for a POSIX compliant tr, Solaris's
        /usr/ucb/tr having been found to cause Rdiff to malfunction.

    o   configure is now generated with autoconf-2.65, which works
        better on recent systems and on Mac OS X.


PACKAGE INSTALLATION

    o   Characters in R source which are not translatable to the
        current locale are now handled more tolerantly:  these will be
        converted to hex codes with a warning.  Such characters are
        only really portable if they appear in comments.

    o   R CMD INSTALL now tests that the installed package can be loaded
        (and backs out the installation if it cannot): this can be
        suppressed by --no-test-load.  This avoids installing/updating
        a package that cannot be used: common causes of failures to
        load are missing/incompatible external software and
        missing/broken dependent packages.

    o   Package installation on Windows for a package with a src
        directory now checks if a DLL is created unless there is a
        src/Makefile.win file: this helps catch broken installations
        where the toolchain has not reported problems in building the DLL.
        (Note: this can be any DLL, not just one named <pkg-name>.dll.)


BUG FIXES

    o   Using with(), eval() etc with a list with some unnamed
        elements now works. (PR#14035)

    o   The "quick" dispatch of S4 methods for primitive functions was
        not happening, forcing a search each time.  (Dispatch for
        closures was not affected.)  A side effect is that default
        values for arguments in a method that do not have defaults in
        the generic will now be ignored.

    o   Trying to dispatch S4 methods for primitives during the search
        for inherited methods slows that search down and potentially
        could cause an infinite recursion.  An internal switch was
        added to turn off all such methods from
        findInheritedMethods().

    o   R framework installation (on Mac OS X) would not work properly
        if a rogue Resources directory was present at the top level.
        Such a non-symlink will now be renamed to Resources.old (and
        anything previously named Resources.old removed) as part of
        the framework installation process.

    o   The checks for conforming S4 method arguments could fail when
        the signature of the generic function omitted some of the
        formal arguments (in addition to ...).  Arguments omitted from
        the method definition but conforming (per the documentation)
        should now be ignored (treated as "ANY") in dispatching.

    o   The computations for S4 method evaluation when '...' was in the
        signature could fail, treating '...' as an ordinary symbol.
        This has been fixed, for the known cases.

    o   Various ar() fitting methods have more protection for singular
        fits.

    o   callNextMethod now works again with the drop= argument in `[`

    o   parse() and parse_Rd() miscounted columns when multibyte UTF-8
        characters were present.

    o   Formatting of help pages has had minor improvements: extra
        blank lines have been removed from the text format, and empty
        package labels removed from HTML.

    o   cor(A, B) where A has n x 1 and B a 1-dimensional array
        segfaulted or gave an internal error.
        (The case cor(B, A) was PR#7116.)

    o   cut.POSIXt() applied to a start value after the DST transition
        on a DST-change day could give the wrong time for 'breaks' in units
        of days or longer.  (PR#14208)

    o   do_par() UNPROTECTed too early (PR#14214)

    o   subassignment x[[....]] <- y didn't check for a zero-length
        right hand side, and inserted rubbish value. (PR#14217)

    o   fisher.test() no longer gives a P-value *very* slightly > 1,
        in some borderline cases.

    o   Internal function matchArgs no longer modifies the general
        purpose bits of the SEXPs that make up the formals list of R
        functions.  This fixes an invalid error message that would
        occur when a garbage collection triggered a second call to
        matchArgs for the same function via a finalizer.

    o   gsub() in 2.10.x could fail from stack overflow for extremely
        long strings due to temporary data being allocated on the
        stack.  Also, gsub() with fixed=TRUE is in some circumstances
        considerably faster.

    o   Several primitives, including attributes(), attr<-()
        interactive(), nargs() and proc.time(), did not check that
        they were called with the correct number of arguments.

    o   A potential race condition in list.files() when other processes
        are operating on the directory has been fixed; the code now
        dynamically allocates memory for file listings in a single
        pass instead of making an initial count pass.

    o   mean(x, trim=, na.rm = FALSE) failed to return NA if 'x'
        contained missing values.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)

    o   Extreme tail behavior of, pbeta() {and hence pf()}, e.g.,
        pbeta(x, 3, 2200, lower.tail=FALSE, log.p=TRUE) now returns
        finite values instead of jumping to -Inf too early (PR#14230).

    o   parse(text=x) misbehaved for objects 'x' that were not coerced
        internally to character, notably symbols.  (Reported to
        R-devel by Bill Dunlap.)

    o   The internal C function 'coerceSymbol' now handles coercion to
        character, and warns if coercion fails (rather than silently
        returning NULL).  This allows a name to be given where a
        character vector is required in functions which coerce
        internally.

    o   The interpretation by strptime() of %c was non-standard (not
        that it is ever advisable to use locale- and system-specific
        input formats).

    o   capabilities("X11") now works the same way on Mac OS X as on
        other platforms (and as documented: it was always true for R
        built with --with-aqua, as the CRAN builds are).

    o   The X11() device with cairo but not Pango (notably Mac OS X)
        now checks validity of text strings in UTF-8 locales (since
        Pango does but cairo it seems does not).

    o   read.fwf() misread multi-line records when n was specified.
        (PR#14241)

    o   all.equal(*, tolerance = e) passes the numeric tolerance also to
        the comparison of the attributes.

    o   pgamma(0,0), a boundary case, now returns 0, its limit from the
        left, rather than the limit from the right.

    o   Issuing POST requests to the internal web server could stall
        the request under certain circumstances.

    o   gzcon( <textConnection> ), an error, no longer damages the
        connection (in a way to have it seg.fault). (PR#14237)

    o   All the results from hist() now use the nominal 'breaks' not
        those adjusted by the numeric 'fuzz": in recent versions the
        nominal 'breaks' were reported but the 'density' referred to
        the intervals used in the calculation -- which mattered very
        slightly for one of the extreme bins.  (Based on a report by
        Martin Becker.)

    o   If xy[z].coords (used internally by many graphics functions) are
        given a list as 'x', they now check that the list has suitable
        names and give a more informative error message.  (PR#13936)

Subject: [R] R 2.11.1 is released
Message-ID: <43D125EC-EEB8-4282-8036-6914335B4159@cbs.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.11.1.tar.gz a short while ago. This is an update release, which fixes a number of mostly minor issues. The most annoying one was probably the problem with format.POSIXlt causing C stack overflow on long date vectors. See the full list of changes below.

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.11.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.11.1


NEW FEATURES

    o   R CMD INSTALL checks if dependent packages are available early on
        in the installation of source packages, thereby giving clearer
        error messages.

    o   R CMD INSTALL --build now names the file in the format used
        for Mac OS X binary files on that platform.

    o   BIC() in package stats4 now also works with multiple fitted models,
        analogously to AIC().


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   Use of file extension .C for C++ code in packages is now
        deprecated: it has caused problems for some 'make's on
        case-insensitive file systems (although it currently works
        with the recommended toolkits).


INSTALLATION

    o   Command 'gnutar' is preferred to 'tar' when configure sets
        TAR.  This is needed on Mac OS 10.6, where the default tar,
        bsdtar 2.6.2, has been reported to produce archives with
        illegal extensions to tar (according to the POSIX standard).


BUG FIXES

    o   The C function mkCharLenCE now no longer reads past 'len' bytes
        (unlikely to be a problem except in user code). (PR#14246)

    o   On systems without any default LD_LIBRARY_PATH (not even
        /usr/local/lib), [DY]LIB_LIBRARY_PATH is now set without a
        trailing colon.  (PR#13637)

    o   More efficient utf8ToInt() on long multi-byte strings with
        many multi-byte characters.  (PR#14262)

    o   aggregate.ts() gave platform-depedent results due to rounding
        error for ndeltat != 1.

    o   package.skeleton() sometimes failed to fix filenames for .R or
        .Rd files to start with an alphanumeric.  (PR#14253)
        It also failed when only an S4 class without any methods was
        defined.  (PR#14280)

    o   splinefun(*, method = "monoH.FC")  was not quite monotone in rare
        cases.  (PR#14215)

    o   Rhttpd no longer crashes due to SIGPIPE when the client closes
        the connection prematurely.  (PR#14266)

    o   format.POSIXlt() could cause a stack overflow and crash when used on
        very long vectors.  (PR#14267)

    o   Rd2latex() incorrectly escaped special characters in \usage sections.

    o   mcnemar.test() could alter the levels (dropping unused levels)
        if passed 'x' and 'y' as factors (reported by Greg Snow).

    o   Rd2pdf sometimes needed a further pdflatex pass to get
        hyperlinked pages correct.

    o   interaction() produced malformed results when levels were
        duplicated, causing segfaults in split().

    o   cut(d, breaks = <n>)  now also works for "Date" or "POSIXt"
        argument d.  (PR#14288)

    o   memDecompress() could decompress incompletely rare xz-compressed
        input due to incorrect documentation of xz utils.  (Report
        and patch from Olaf Mersmann.)

    o   The S4 initialize() methods for "matrix", "array", and "ts" have
        been fixed to call validObject(). (PR#14284)

    o   R CMD INSTALL now behaves the same way with or without
        --no-multiarch on platforms with only one installed
        architecture.  (It used to clean the src directory without
        --no-multiarch.)

    o   [<-.data.frame was not quite careful enough in assigning (and
        potentially deleting) columns right-to-left. (PR#14263)

    o   rbeta(n, a,b) no longer occasionally returns NaN for a >> 1 > b.
        (PR#14291)

    o   pnorm(x, log.p = TRUE) could return NaN not -Inf for x near
        (minus for lower.tail=TRUE) the largest representable number.

    o   Compressed data files *.(txt|tab|csv).(gz|bz2|xz) were not
        recognized for the list of data topics and hence for packages
        using LazyData.  (PR#14273)

    o   textConnection() did an unnecessary translation on strings in
        a foreign encoding (e.g. UTF-8 strings on Windows) and so was
        slower than it could have been on very long input strings.
        (PR#14286)
        
    o   tools::Rd2txt() did not render poorly written Rd files
        consistently with other renderers.

    o   na.action() did not extract the 'na.action' component as
        duplicated, causing segfaults in split().

    o   cut(d, breaks = <n>)  now also works for "Date" or "POSIXt"
        argument d.  (PR#14288)

    o   memDecompress() could decompress incompletely rare xz-compressed
    o   On systems without any default LD_LIBRARY_PATH (not even
        /usr/local/lib), [DY]LIB_LIBRARY_PATH is now set without a
        trailing colon.  (PR#13637)

    o   na.action() did not extract the 'na.action' component as
        documented.

Subject: Next release of R planned to be 2.12.0
Message-ID: <56B157DD-AB7C-4AC6-A53B-EB40146CA22E@cbs.dk>

This mainly as a thumbs-up to sysadmins planning installation for the Fall semester: 

Only a small number of low-impact bugs have been found since the 2.11.1 release so we have decided NOT to do a 2.11.2, but head straight for 2.12.0 some time in October.

Subject: useR! 2011: announcement and call for tutorials
Message-ID: <4C61341B.2000501@warwick.ac.uk>

We are pleased to announce that the R user conference

   useR! 2011

is scheduled for August 16-18, 2011, and will take place at the
University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.

As for the predecessor conferences, the program will consist of two
parts: invited lectures and user-contributed sessions (abstract
submission will be available online later this year). Prior to the
conference, there will be tutorials on R (proposals for tutorials should
be sent before October 29, 2010, see below).

INVITED SPEAKERS

Adrian Bowman, Lee Edlefsen, Ulrike Gr?mping, Wolfgang Huber, Brian
Ripley, Jonathan Rougier, Simon Urbanek, and Brandon Whitcher.

USER-CONTRIBUTED SESSIONS

The conference will feature both talks and posters illustrating the use
of R in practice. Contributions are welcome that introduce recent
developments in the R Project (including CRAN packages), demonstrate
applications of R in areas of current interest, or otherwise engage and
inspire participants in their use of R.

PRE-CONFERENCE TUTORIALS

Before the official program, half-day tutorials will be offered on
Monday, August 15.

We invite R users to submit proposals for three hour tutorials on
special topics regarding R. The proposals should give a brief
description of the tutorial, including goals, detailed outline,
justification of why the tutorial is important, background knowledge
required and potential attendees. The proposals should be sent before
October 29, 2010 to useR-2011_at_R-project.org.

A web page offering more information on the `useR!' conference is
available at

   http://www.R-project.org/useR-2011

We hope to see you in Coventry!

The organizing committee:

John Aston, Julia Brettschneider, David Firth, Ashley Ford, Ioannis
Kosmidis, Tom Nichols, Elke Th?nnes and Heather Turner

Subject: R 2.12.0 is released
Message-ID: <33418B16-385D-47C1-B0CD-6D16B4B353B3@cbs.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.12.0.tar.gz a short while ago. This is a development
release which contains a number of new features.

Also, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.12.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.0:

  NEW FEATURES:

    ? Reading a packages's CITATION file now defaults to ASCII rather
      than Latin-1: a package with a non-ASCII CITATION file should
      declare an encoding in its DESCRIPTION file and use that encoding
      for the CITATION file.

    ? difftime() now defaults to the "tzone" attribute of "POSIXlt"
      objects rather than to the current timezone as set by the default
      for the tz argument.  (Wish of PR#14182.)

    ? pretty() is now generic, with new methods for "Date" and "POSIXt"
      classes (based on code contributed by Felix Andrews).

    ? unique() and match() are now faster on character vectors where
      all elements are in the global CHARSXP cache and have unmarked
      encoding (ASCII).  Thanks to Matthew Dowle for suggesting
      improvements to the way the hash code is generated in unique.c.

    ? The enquote() utility, in use internally, is exported now.

    ? .C() and .Fortran() now map non-zero return values (other than
      NA_LOGICAL) for logical vectors to TRUE: it has been an implicit
      assumption that they are treated as true.

    ? The print() methods for "glm" and "lm" objects now insert
      linebreaks in long calls in the same way that the print() methods
      for "summary.[g]lm" objects have long done.  This does change the
      layout of the examples for a number of packages, e.g. MASS.
      (PR#14250)

    ? constrOptim() can now be used with method "SANN".  (PR#14245)

      It gains an argument hessian to be passed to optim(), which
      allows all the ... arguments to be intended for f() and grad().
      (PR#14071)

    ? curve() now allows expr to be an object of mode "expression" as
      well as "call" and "function".

    ? The "POSIX[cl]t" methods for Axis() have been replaced by a
      single method for "POSIXt".

      There are no longer separate plot() methods for "POSIX[cl]t" and
      "Date": the default method has been able to handle those classes
      for a long time.  This _inter alia_ allows a single date-time
      object to be supplied, the wish of PR#14016.

      The methods had a different default ("") for xlab.

    ? Classes "POSIXct", "POSIXlt" and "difftime" have generators
      .POSIXct(), .POSIXlt() and .difftime().  Package authors are
      advised to make use of them (they are available from R 2.11.0) to
      proof against planned future changes to the classes.

      The ordering of the classes has been changed, so "POSIXt" is now
      the second class.  See the document ?Updating packages for
      changes in R 2.12.x? on <URL: http://developer.r-project.org> for
      the consequences for a handful of CRAN packages.

    ? The "POSIXct" method of as.Date() allows a timezone to be
      specified (but still defaults to UTC).

    ? New list2env() utility function as an inverse of
      as.list(<environment>) and for fast multi-assign() to existing
      environment.  as.environment() is now generic and uses list2env()
      as list method.

    ? There are several small changes to output which ?zap? small
      numbers, e.g. in printing quantiles of residuals in summaries
      from "lm" and "glm" fits, and in test statisics in print.anova().

    ? Special names such as "dim", "names", etc, are now allowed as
      slot names of S4 classes, with "class" the only remaining
      exception.

    ? File .Renviron can have architecture-specific versions such as
      .Renviron.i386 on systems with sub-architectures.

    ? installed.packages() has a new argument subarch to filter on
      sub-architecture.

    ? The summary() method for packageStatus() now has a separate
      print() method.

    ? The default summary() method returns an object inheriting from
      class "summaryDefault" which has a separate print() method that
      calls zapsmall() for numeric/complex values.

    ? The startup message now includes the platform and if used,
      sub-architecture: this is useful where different
      (sub-)architectures run on the same OS.

    ? The getGraphicsEvent() mechanism now allows multiple windows to
      return graphics events, through the new functions
      setGraphicsEventHandlers(), setGraphicsEventEnv(), and
      getGraphicsEventEnv().  (Currently implemented in the windows()
      and X11() devices.)

    ? tools::texi2dvi() gains an index argument, mainly for use by R
      CMD Rd2pdf.

      It avoids the use of texindy by texinfo's texi2dvi >= 1.157,
      since that does not emulate 'makeindex' well enough to avoid
      problems with special characters (such as (, {, !) in indices.

    ? The ability of readLines() and scan() to re-encode inputs to
      marked UTF-8 strings on Windows since R 2.7.0 is extended to
      non-UTF-8 locales on other OSes.

    ? scan() gains a fileEncoding argument to match read.table().

    ? points() and lines() gain "table" methods to match plot().  (Wish
      of PR#10472.)

    ? Sys.chmod() allows argument mode to be a vector, recycled along
      paths.

    ? There are |, & and xor() methods for classes "octmode" and
      "hexmode", which work bitwise.

    ? Environment variables R_DVIPSCMD, R_LATEXCMD, R_MAKEINDEXCMD,
      R_PDFLATEXCMD are no longer used nor set in an R session.  (With
      the move to tools::texi2dvi(), the conventional environment
      variables LATEX, MAKEINDEX and PDFLATEX will be used.
      options("dvipscmd") defaults to the value of DVIPS, then to
      "dvips".)

    ? New function isatty() to see if terminal connections are
      redirected.

    ? summaryRprof() returns the sampling interval in component
      sample.interval and only returns in by.self data for functions
      with non-zero self times.

    ? print(x) and str(x) now indicate if an empty list x is named.

    ? install.packages() and remove.packages() with lib unspecified and
      multiple libraries in .libPaths() inform the user of the library
      location used with a message rather than a warning.

    ? There is limited support for multiple compressed streams on a
      file: all of [bgx]zfile() allow streams to be appended to an
      existing file, but bzfile() reads only the first stream.

    ? Function person() in package utils now uses a given/family scheme
      in preference to first/middle/last, is vectorized to handle an
      arbitrary number of persons, and gains a role argument to specify
      person roles using a controlled vocabulary (the MARC relator
      terms).

    ? Package utils adds a new "bibentry" class for representing and
      manipulating bibliographic information in enhanced BibTeX style,
      unifying and enhancing the previously existing mechanisms.

    ? A bibstyle() function has been added to the tools package with
      default JSS style for rendering "bibentry" objects, and a
      mechanism for registering other rendering styles.

    ? Several aspects of the display of text help are now customizable
      using the new Rd2txt_options() function.
      options("help_text_width") is no longer used.

    ? Added \href tag to the Rd format, to allow hyperlinks to URLs
      without displaying the full URL.

    ? Added \newcommand and \renewcommand tags to the Rd format, to
      allow user-defined macros.

    ? New toRd() generic in the tools package to convert objects to
      fragments of Rd code, and added "fragment" argument to Rd2txt(),
      Rd2HTML(), and Rd2latex() to support it.

    ? Directory R_HOME/share/texmf now follows the TDS conventions, so
      can be set as a texmf tree (?root directory? in MiKTeX parlance).

    ? S3 generic functions now use correct S4 inheritance when
      dispatching on an S4 object.  See ?Methods, section on ?Methods
      for S3 Generic Functions? for recommendations and details.

    ? format.pval() gains a ... argument to pass arguments such as
      nsmall to format().  (Wish of PR#9574)

    ? legend() supports title.adj.  (Wish of PR#13415)

    ? Added support for subsetting "raster" objects, plus assigning to
      a subset, conversion to a matrix (of colour strings), and
      comparisons (== and !=).

    ? Added a new parseLatex() function (and related functions
      deparseLatex() and latexToUtf8()) to support conversion of
      bibliographic entries for display in R.

    ? Text rendering of \itemize in help uses a Unicode bullet in UTF-8
      and most single-byte Windows locales.

    ? Added support for polygons with holes to the graphics engine.
      This is implemented for the pdf(), postscript(),
      x11(type="cairo"), windows(), and quartz() devices (and
      associated raster formats), but not for x11(type="Xlib") or
      xfig() or pictex().  The user-level interface is the polypath()
      function in graphics and grid.path() in grid.

    ? File NEWS is now generated at installation with a slightly
      different format: it will be in UTF-8 on platforms using UTF-8,
      and otherwise in ASCII.  There is also a PDF version, NEWS.pdf,
      installed at the top-level of the R distribution.

    ? kmeans(x, 1) now works.  Further, kmeans now returns between and
      total sum of squares.

    ? arrayInd() and which() gain an argument useNames.  For arrayInd,
      the default is now false, for speed reasons.

    ? As is done for closures, the default print method for the formula
      class now displays the associated environment if it is not the
      global environment.

    ? A new facility has been added for inserting code into a package
      without re-installing it, to facilitate testing changes which can
      be selectively added and backed out.  See ?insertSource.

    ? New function readRenviron to (re-)read files in the format of
      ~/.Renviron and Renviron.site.

    ? require() will now return FALSE (and not fail) if loading the
      package or one of its dependencies fails.

    ? aperm() now allows argument perm to be a character vector when
      the array has named dimnames (as the results of table() calls
      do).  Similarly, array() allows MARGIN to be a character vector.
      (Based on suggestions of Michael Lachmann.)

    ? Package utils now exports and documents functions
      aspell_package_Rd_files() and aspell_package_vignettes() for
      spell checking package Rd files and vignettes using Aspell,
      Ispell or Hunspell.

    ? Package news can now be given in Rd format, and news() prefers
      these inst/NEWS.Rd files to old-style plain text NEWS or
      inst/NEWS files.

    ? New simple function packageVersion().

    ? The PCRE library has been updated to version 8.10.

    ? The standard Unix-alike terminal interface declares its name to
      readline as 'R', so that can be used for conditional sections in
      ~/.inputrc files.

    ? ?Writing R Extensions? now stresses that the standard sections in
      .Rd files (other than \alias, \keyword and \note) are intended to
      be unique, and the conversion tools now drop duplicates with a
      warning.

      The .Rd conversion tools also warn about an unrecognized type in
      a \docType section.

    ? ecdf() objects now have a quantile() method.

    ? format() methods for date-time objects now attempt to make use of
      a "tzone" attribute with "%Z" and "%z" formats, but it is not
      always possible.  (Wish of PR#14358.)

    ? tools::texi2dvi(file, clean = TRUE) now works in more cases (e.g.
      where emulation is used and when file is not in the current
      directory).

    ? New function droplevels() to remove unused factor levels.

    ? system(command, intern = TRUE) now gives an error on a Unix-alike
      (as well as on Windows) if command cannot be run.  It reports a
      non-success exit status from running command as a warning.

      On a Unix-alike an attempt is made to return the actual exit
      status of the command in system(intern = FALSE): previously this
      had been system-dependent but on POSIX-compliant systems the
      value return was 256 times the status.

    ? system() has a new argument ignore.stdout which can be used to
      (portably) ignore standard output.

    ? system(intern = TRUE) and pipe() connections are guaranteed to be
      avaliable on all builds of R.

    ? Sys.which() has been altered to return "" if the command is not
      found (even on Solaris).

    ? A facility for defining reference-based S4 classes (in the OOP
      style of Java, C++, etc.) has been added experimentally to
      package methods; see ?ReferenceClasses.

    ? The predict method for "loess" fits gains an na.action argument
      which defaults to na.pass rather than the previous default of
      na.omit.

      Predictions from "loess" fits are now named from the row names of
      newdata.

    ? Parsing errors detected during Sweave() processing will now be
      reported referencing their original location in the source file.

    ? New adjustcolor() utility, e.g., for simple translucent color
      schemes.

    ? qr() now has a trivial lm method with a simple (fast) validity
      check.

    ? An experimental new programming model has been added to package
      methods for reference (OOP-style) classes and methods.  See
      ?ReferenceClasses.

    ? bzip2 has been updated to version 1.0.6 (bug-fix release).
      --with-system-bzlib now requires at least version 1.0.6.

    ? R now provides jss.cls and jss.bst (the class and bib style file
      for the Journal of Statistical Software) as well as RJournal.bib
      and Rnews.bib, and R CMD ensures that the .bst and .bib files are
      found by BibTeX.

    ? Functions using the TAR environment variable no longer quote the
      value when making system calls.  This allows values such as tar
      --force-local, but does require additional quotes in, e.g., TAR =
      "'/path with spaces/mytar'".

  DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT:

    ? Supplying the parser with a character string containing both
      octal/hex and Unicode escapes is now an error.

    ? File extension .C for C++ code files in packages is now defunct.

    ? R CMD check no longer supports configuration files containing
      Perl configuration variables: use the environment variables
      documented in ?R Internals? instead.

    ? The save argument of require() now defaults to FALSE and save =
      TRUE is now deprecated.  (This facility is very rarely actually
      used, and was superseded by the Depends field of the DESCRIPTION
      file long ago.)

    ? R CMD check --no-latex is deprecated in favour of --no-manual.

    ? R CMD Sd2Rd is formally deprecated and will be removed in R
      2.13.0.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    ? install.packages() has a new argument libs_only to optionally
      pass --libs-only to R CMD INSTALL and works analogously for
      Windows binary installs (to add support for 64- or 32-bit
      Windows).

    ? When sub-architectures are in use, the installed architectures
      are recorded in the Archs field of the DESCRIPTION file.  There
      is a new default filter, "subarch", in available.packages() to
      make use of this.

      Code is compiled in a copy of the src directory when a package is
      installed for more than one sub-architecture: this avoid problems
      with cleaning the sources between building sub-architectures.

    ? R CMD INSTALL --libs-only no longer overrides the setting of
      locking, so a previous version of the package will be restored
      unless --no-lock is specified.

  UTILITIES:

    ? R CMD Rprof|build|check are now based on R rather than Perl
      scripts.  The only remaining Perl scripts are the deprecated R
      CMD Sd2Rd and install-info.pl (used only if install-info is not
      found) as well as some maintainer-mode-only scripts.

      *NB:* because these have been completely rewritten, users should
      not expect undocumented details of previous implementations to
      have been duplicated.

      R CMD no longer manipulates the environment variables PERL5LIB
      and PERLLIB.

    ? R CMD check has a new argument --extra-arch to confine tests to
      those needed to check an additional sub-architecture.

      Its check for ?Subdirectory 'inst' contains no files? is more
      thorough: it looks for files, and warns if there are only empty
      directories.

      Environment variables such as R_LIBS and those used for
      customization can be set for the duration of checking _via_ a
      file ~/.R/check.Renviron (in the format used by .Renviron, and
      with sub-architecture specific versions such as
      ~/.R/check.Renviron.i386 taking precedence).

      There are new options --multiarch to check the package under all
      of the installed sub-architectures and --no-multiarch to confine
      checking to the sub-architecture under which check is invoked.
      If neither option is supplied, a test is done of installed
      sub-architectures and all those which can be run on the current
      OS are used.

      Unless multiple sub-architectures are selected, the install done
      by check for testing purposes is only of the current
      sub-architecture (_via_ R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch).

      It will skip the check for non-ascii characters in code or data
      if the environment variables _R_CHECK_ASCII_CODE_ or
      _R_CHECK_ASCII_DATA_ are respectively set to FALSE.  (Suggestion
      of Vince Carey.)

    ? R CMD build no longer creates an INDEX file (R CMD INSTALL does
      so), and --force removes (rather than overwrites) an existing
      INDEX file.

      It supports a file ~/.R/build.Renviron analogously to check.

      It now runs build-time \Sexpr expressions in help files.

    ? R CMD Rd2dvi makes use of tools::texi2dvi() to process the
      package manual.  It is now implemented entirely in R (rather than
      partially as a shell script).

    ? R CMD Rprof now uses utils::summaryRprof() rather than Perl.  It
      has new arguments to select one of the tables and to limit the
      number of entries printed.

    ? R CMD Sweave now runs R with --vanilla so the environment setting
      of R_LIBS will always be used.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    ? lang5() and lang6() (in addition to pre-existing lang[1-4]())
      convenience functions for easier construction of eval() calls.
      If you have your own definition, do wrap it inside #ifndef lang5
      .... #endif to keep it working with old and new R.

    ? Header R.h now includes only the C headers it itself needs, hence
      no longer includes errno.h.  (This helps avoid problems when it
      is included from C++ source files.)

    ? Headers Rinternals.h and R_ext/Print.h include the C++ versions
      of stdio.h and stdarg.h respectively if included from a C++
      source file.

  INSTALLATION:

    ? A C99 compiler is now required, and more C99 language features
      will be used in the R sources.

    ? Tcl/Tk >= 8.4 is now required (increased from 8.3).

    ? System functions access, chdir and getcwd are now essential to
      configure R.  (In practice they have been required for some
      time.)

    ? make check compares the output of the examples from several of
      the base packages to reference output rather than the previous
      output (if any).  Expect some differences due to differences in
      floating-point computations between platforms.

    ? File NEWS is no longer in the sources, but generated as part of
      the installation.  The primary source for changes is now
      doc/NEWS.Rd.

    ? The popen system call is now required to build R.  This ensures
      the availability of system(intern = TRUE), pipe() connections and
      printing from postscript().

    ? The pkg-config file libR.pc now also works when R is installed
      using a sub-architecture.

    ? R has always required a BLAS that conforms to IE60559 arithmetic,
      but after discovery of more real-world problems caused by a BLAS
      that did not, this is tested more thoroughly in this version.

  BUG FIXES:

    ? Calls to selectMethod() by default no longer cache inherited
      methods.  This could previously corrupt methods used by as().

    ? The densities of non-central chi-squared are now more accurate in
      some cases in the extreme tails, e.g. dchisq(2000, 2, 1000), as a
      series expansion was truncated too early.  (PR#14105)

    ? pt() is more accurate in the left tail for ncp large, e.g.
      pt(-1000, 3, 200).  (PR#14069)

    ? The default C function (R_binary) for binary ops now sets the S4
      bit in the result if either argument is an S4 object.  (PR#13209)

    ? source(echo=TRUE) failed to echo comments that followed the last
      statement in a file.

    ? S4 classes that contained one of "matrix", "array" or "ts" and
      also another class now accept superclass objects in new().  Also
      fixes failure to call validObject() for these classes.

    ? Conditional inheritance defined by argument test in
      methods::setIs() will no longer be used in S4 method selection
      (caching these methods could give incorrect results).  See
      ?setIs.

    ? The signature of an implicit generic is now used by setGeneric()
      when that does not use a definition nor explicitly set a
      signature.

    ? A bug in callNextMethod() for some examples with "..." in the
      arguments has been fixed.  See file
      src/library/methods/tests/nextWithDots.R in the sources.

    ? match(x, table) (and hence %in%) now treat "POSIXlt" consistently
      with, e.g., "POSIXct".

    ? Built-in code dealing with environments (get(), assign(),
      parent.env(), is.environment() and others) now behave
      consistently to recognize S4 subclasses; is.name() also
      recognizes subclasses.

    ? The abs.tol control parameter to nlminb() now defaults to 0.0 to
      avoid false declarations of convergence in objective functions
      that may go negative.

    ? The standard Unix-alike termination dialog to ask whether to save
      the workspace takes a EOF response as n to avoid problems with a
      damaged terminal connection.  (PR#14332)

    ? Added warn.unused argument to hist.default() to allow suppression
      of spurious warnings about graphical parameters used with
      plot=FALSE.  (PR#14341)

    ? predict.lm(), summary.lm(), and indeed lm() itself had issues
      with residual DF in zero-weighted cases (the latter two only in
      connection with empty models). (Thanks to Bill Dunlap for
      spotting the predict() case.)

    ? aperm() treated resize = NA as resize = TRUE.

    ? constrOptim() now has an improved convergence criterion, notably
      for cases where the minimum was (very close to) zero; further,
      other tweaks inspired from code proposals by Ravi Varadhan.

    ? Rendering of S3 and S4 methods in man pages has been corrected
      and made consistent across output formats.

    ? Simple markup is now allowed in \title sections in .Rd files.

    ? The behaviour of as.logical() on factors (to use the levels) was
      lost in R 2.6.0 and has been restored.

    ? prompt() did not backquote some default arguments in the \usage
      section.  (Reported by Claudia Beleites.)

    ? writeBin() disallows attempts to write 2GB or more in a single
      call. (PR#14362)

    ? new() and getClass() will now work if Class is a subclass of
      "classRepresentation" and should also be faster in typical calls.

    ? The summary() method for data frames makes a better job of names
      containing characters invalid in the current locale.

    ? [[ sub-assignment for factors could create an invalid factor
      (reported by Bill Dunlap).

    ? Negate(f) would not evaluate argument f until first use of
      returned function (reported by Olaf Mersmann).

    ? quietly=FALSE is now also an optional argument of library(), and
      consequently, quietly is now propagated also for loading
      dependent packages, e.g., in require(*, quietly=TRUE).

    ? If the loop variable in a for loop was deleted, it would be
      recreated as a global variable.  (Reported by Radford Neal; the
      fix includes his optimizations as well.)

    ? Task callbacks could report the wrong expression when the task
      involved parsing new code. (PR#14368)

    ? getNamespaceVersion() failed; this was an accidental change in
      2.11.0. (PR#14374)

    ? identical() returned FALSE for external pointer objects even when
      the pointer addresses were the same.

    ? L$a at x[] <- val did not duplicate in a case it should have.

    ? tempfile() now always gives a random file name (even if the
      directory is specified) when called directly after startup and
      before the R RNG had been used.  (PR#14381)

    ? quantile(type=6) behaved inconsistently.  (PR#14383)

    ? backSpline(.) behaved incorrectly when the knot sequence was
      decreasing.  (PR#14386)

    ? The reference BLAS included in R was assuming that 0*x and x*0
      were always zero (whereas they could be NA or NaN in IEC 60559
      arithmetic).  This was seen in results from tcrossprod, and for
      example that log(0) %*% 0 gave 0.

    ? The calculation of whether text was completely outside the device
      region (in which case, you draw nothing) was wrong for screen
      devices (which have [0, 0] at top-left).  The symptom was (long)
      text disappearing when resizing a screen window (to make it
      smaller).  (PR#14391)

    ? model.frame(drop.unused.levels = TRUE) did not take into account
      NA values of factors when deciding to drop levels. (PR#14393)

    ? library.dynam.unload required an absolute path for libpath.
      (PR#14385)

      Both library() and loadNamespace() now record absolute paths for
      use by searchpaths() and getNamespaceInfo(ns, "path").

    ? The self-starting model NLSstClosestX failed if some deviation
      was exactly zero.  (PR#14384)

    ? X11(type = "cairo") (and other devices such as png using
      cairographics) and which use Pango font selection now work around
      a bug in Pango when very small fonts (those with sizes between 0
      and 1 in Pango's internal units) are requested.  (PR#14369)

    ? Added workaround for the font problem with X11(type = "cairo")
      and similar on Mac OS X whereby italic and bold styles were
      interchanged.  (PR#13463 amongst many other reports.)

    ? source(chdir = TRUE) failed to reset the working directory if it
      could not be determined - that is now an error.

    ? Fix for crash of example(rasterImage) on x11(type="Xlib").

    ? Force Quartz to bring the on-screen display up-to-date
      immediately before the snapshot is taken by grid.cap() in the
      Cocoa implementation. (PR#14260)

    ? model.frame had an unstated 500 byte limit on variable names.
      (Example reported by Terry Therneau.)

    ? The 256-byte limit on names is now documented.

    ? Subassignment by [, [[ or $ on an expression object with value
      NULL coerced the object to a list.

Subject: [R] R 2.12.1 is released
Message-ID: <36B535C9-D476-450F-96FA-A85158C416B7@cbs.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.12.1.tar.gz a short while ago. This is an update release, which fixes a number of mostly minor issues, and some consolidation within the area of reference classes. The most serious issues were probably that we were not catching misspelled NAMESPACE directives and not catching accidentally unnamed switch() arguments (notice that fixing either will likely uncover errors in preexisting code) 

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.12.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

R News

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.1:

  NEW FEATURES:

    ? The DVI/PDF reference manual now includes the help pages for all
      the standard packages: splines, stats4 and tcltk were previously
      omitted (intentionally).

    ? <URL: http://www.rforge.net> has been added to the default set of
      repositories known to setRepositories().

    ? xz-utils has been updated to version 5.0.0.

    ? reshape() now makes use of sep when forming names during
      reshaping to wide format.  (PR#14435)

    ? legend() allows the length of lines to be set by the end user
      _via_ the new argument seg.len.

    ? New reference class utility methods copy(), field(),
      getRefClass() and getClass() have been added.

    ? When a character value is used for the EXPR argument in switch(),
      a warning is given if more than one unnamed alternative value is
      given.  This will become an error in R 2.13.0.

    ? StructTS(type = "BSM") now allows series with just two seasons.
      (Reported by Birgit Erni.)

  INSTALLATION:

    ? The PDF reference manual is now built as PDF version 1.5 with
      object compression, which on platforms for which this is not the
      default (notably MiKTeX) halves its size.

    ? Variable FCLIBS can be set during configuration, for any
      additional library flags needed when linking a shared object with
      the Fortran 9x compiler.  (Needed with Solaris Studio 12.2.)

  BUG FIXES:

    ? seq.int() no longer sometimes evaluates arguments twice.
      (PR#14388)

    ? The data.frame method of format() failed if a column name was
      longer than 256 bytes (the maximum length allowed for an R name).

    ? predict(<lm object>, type ="terms", ...) failed if both terms and
      interval were specified.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)

      Also, if se.fit = TRUE the standard errors were reported for all
      terms, not just those selected by a non-null terms.

    ? The TRE regular expressions engine could terminate R rather than
      give an error when given certain invalid regular expressions.
      (PR#14398)

    ? cmdscale(eig = TRUE) was documented to return n-1 eigenvalues but
      in fact only returned k.  It now returns all n eigenvalues.

      cmdscale(add = TRUE) failed to centre the return configuration
      and sometimes lost the labels on the points.  Its return value
      was described wrongly (it is always a list and contains component
      ac).

    ? promptClass() in package methods now works for reference classes
      and gives a suitably specialized skeleton of documentation.

      Also, callSuper() now works via the methods() invocation as well
      as for initially specified methods.

    ? download.file() could leave the destination file open if the URL
      was not able to be opened.  (PR#14414)

    ? Assignment of an environment to functions or as an attribute to
      other objects now works for S4 subclasses of "environment".

    ? Use of [[<- for S4 subclasses of "environment" generated an
      infinite recursion from the method.  The method has been replaced
      by internal code.

    ? In a reference class S4 method, callSuper() now works in
      initialize() methods when there is no explicit superclass method.

    ? ! dropped attributes such as names and dimensions from a
      length-zero argument.  (PR#14424)

    ? When list2env() created an environment it was missing a PROTECT
      call and so was vulnerable to garbage collection.

    ? Sweave() with keep.source=TRUE dropped comments at the start and
      end of code chunks.  It could also fail when \SweaveInput was
      combined with named chunks.

    ? The Fortran code used by nls(algorithm = "port") could
      infinite-loop when compiled with high optimization on a modern
      version of gcc, and SAFE_FFLAGS is now used to make this less
      likely.  (PR#14427, seen with 32-bit Windows using gcc 4.5.0 used
      from R 2.12.0.)

    ? sapply() with default simplify = TRUE and mapply() with default
      SIMPLIFY = TRUE wrongly simplified language-like results, as,
      e.g., in mapply(1:2, c(3,7), FUN = function(i,j) call(':',i,j)).

    ? Backreferences to undefined patterns in [g]sub(pcre = TRUE) could
      cause a segfault.  (PR#14431)

    ? The format() (and hence the print()) method for class "Date"
      rounded fractional dates towards zero: it now always rounds them
      down.

    ? Reference S4 class creation could generate ambiguous inheritance
      patterns under very special circumstances.

    ? [[<- turned S4 subclasses of "environment" into plain
      environments.

    ? Long titles for help pages were truncated in package indices and
      a few other places.

    ? Additional utilities now work correctly with S4 subclasses of
      "environment" (rm, locking tools and active bindings).

    ? spec.ar() now also work for the "ols" method.  (Reported by
      Hans-Ruedi Kuensch.)

    ? The initialization of objects from S4 subclasses of "environment"
      now allocates a new environment object.

    ? R CMD check has more protection against (probably erroneous)
      example or test output which is invalid in the current locale.

    ? qr.X() with column names and pivoting now also pivots the column
      names.  (PR#14438)

    ? unit.pmax() and unit.pmin() in package grid gave incorrect
      results when all inputs were of length 1.  (PR#14443)

    ? The parser for NAMESPACE files ignored misspelled directives,
      rather than signalling an error.  For 2.12.x a warning will be
      issued, but this will be correctly reported as an error in later
      releases. (Reported by Charles Berry.)

    ? Fix for subsetting of "raster" objects when only one of i or j is
      specified.

    ? grid.raster() in package grid did not accept "nativeRaster"
      objects (like rasterImage() does).

    ? Rendering raster images in PDF output was resetting the clipping
      region.

    ? Rendering of raster images on Cairo X11 device was wrong,
      particularly when a small image was being scaled up using
      interpolation.

      With Cairo < 1.6, will be better than before, though still a
      little clunky.  With Cairo >= 1.6, should be sweet as.

    ? Several bugs fixed in read.DIF(): single column inputs caused
      errors, cells marked as "character" could be converted to other
      types, and (in Windows) copying from the clipboard failed.
