Subject: Abstract submission deadline for useR! 2009
Message-ID: <49885C85.7010508@agrocampus-ouest.fr>

Dear members of the R user community,

the submission deadline for useR! 2009 (Rennes, France, July 8 to 10,
2009) is approaching:

   Submission deadline: 2009-02-27

(and along with that the early registration deadline).

We encourage you to give a presentation at the conference and submit an
abstract or a poster on topics presenting innovations or exciting
applications of R. You can use the conference Web page at

   http://www.R-project.org/useR-2009/


Invited speakers will include: Adele Cutler, Peter Dalgaard, Jerome H.
Friedman,  Michael Greenacre, Trevor Hastie, John Storey, Martin Theus.

July 7, 2009, half-day tutorials are presented by R experts prior to the
conference.

The conference web page:
http://www.agrocampus-ouest.fr/math/useR-2009/accomodation.html
gives a list of hotels and some student rooms (200) are also available
on the campus (Rennes will be very busy at the conference time because
the cultural event `Festival Les tomb?es de la nuit' will take place at
the same time, so we recommend to book as soon as possible).

We hope to meet you in Rennes!

F. Husson
for the organizing committee.

   April 24 & 25, Chicago, IL, US
  
   The first annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using R , the
   premier free software system for statistical computation and graphics,
   will be held this spring in Chicago, IL, USA on Friday April 24 and
   Saturday April 25.

   The two-day conference will cover topics as diverse as portfolio theory,
   time-series analysis, as well as advanced risk tools, high-performance
   computing, and econometrics. All will be discussed within the context of
   using R as a primary tool for financial risk management and trading.

Subject: REMINDER: DSC 2009 abstract submission before March 15
Message-ID: <49AD3ED1.20504@biostat.ku.dk>

Just a friendly reminder that the closing date for abstract submissions
for the DSC conference in Copenhagen is next Sunday.

See

http://www.r-project.org/dsc-2009

Notice that the website has been revised since we decided to engage a
professional convention bureau. The good news is that payment by credit
card is now possible. The slightly bad news is that there are now two
separate registration paths: one for participation and one for abstracts.

Subject: R 2.9.0 is released
Message-ID: <49E84433.2030805@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.9.0.tar.gz a short while ago. This is a development
release which contains a number of new features.

Also, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it (later today) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.9.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. In case of
impatience, try http://www.biostat.ku.dk/~pd/R-release

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.9.0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o   expand.grid() by default no longer coerces strings into factors.


NEW FEATURES

    o   Package 'Matrix' is now a recommended package contained in the
        basic R distribution.  It provides S4 classes and methods for
        dense and sparse matrices, often by using the numerical
        libraries Lapack and from the SuiteSparse collection CHOLMOD,
        CSparse, and SPQR among others.

    o   pdf() and postscript() gain a 'useKerning' argument to place
        strings using kerning (which had previously been ignored in
        display but not in strwidth), based in part on an idea and
        code from Ei-ji Nakama. The default is TRUE.

        Kerning involving spaces is now ignored (it was previously
        only used in the computation of string widths).

    o   seq.default() and seq.int() ensure that the result is within the
        interval [from, to] even when the last value would previously
        have been slightly out of range because of the allowance for
        rounding error in computing the number of elements.

    o   boxplot() gains a simple 'matrix' method, enabling boxplot(mat)
        instead of boxplot(data.frame(mat)).

    o   zip.file.extract() gains an optional 'dir' argument (but use
        unzip() instead).

    o   source() with 'encoding' specified (and not as "unknown") marks
        the encoding of character strings in Latin-1 and UTF-8
        locales.

    o   parse(text=z) now marks the encoding of character strings in
        Latin-1 and UTF-8 locales if 'z' is of known encoding (that is
        all elements are either ASCII or marked as Latin-1 or UTF-8).

    o   sprintf() does stricter error checking on input formats to
        avoid passing invalid formats to the OS (which have a tendency
        to crash under such inputs).

    o   expand.grid() gains a 'stringsAsFactor' argument to ask for
        automatic conversion of character vectors to factors (which
        happened for many years but was not previously documented, and
        is no longer the default).

    o   bxp() now coputes the 'ylim' including the outliers only if
        'outline = TRUE'.  (Wish of PR#13196)

    o   barplot() gains a 'args.legend' argument.  (Wish of PR#13265).

    o   RweaveLatexSetup() now accepts all (and not just some) options
        passed through from Sweave()

    o   cumsum(x) and cumprod(x) for double precision x now use a long
        double accumulator where available and so more closely match
        sum() and prod() in potentially being more accurate.

    o   plot() methods for "stepfun" (and hence "ecdf") gain an 'col'
        argument, allowing to set all three colors simultaneously.

    o   Iterating over a factor in a for loop now coerces to a character
        vector (rather than using the integer codes).

    o   data.frame() now recycles columns of list arguments, not just
        vectors and factors.

    o   plot.ts(plot.type="multiple") now makes use of *.lab and
        *.axis graphical parameters (wish of PR#13134 and 13135).

    o   Classes can be exported from a name space using the NAMESPACE
        file directive 'exportClassPattern' which has the same syntax
        as 'exportPattern'.

    o   strftime() now converts its first argument with as.POSIXlt()
        and so is no longer an alias for format.POSIXLt.

    o   body<-() now treats list values consistently with other
        types: they no longer need to be wrapped in a list() call.

    o   option("pdfbrowser") is now set on Windows as well as on
Unix-alikes.

    o   object.size() now returns an object of class "object_size" and
        has a print() method.

    o   [col/row]Sums(), *Means() now have an additional '...' argument,
        so that they can more easily be turned into generic functions.

    o   Package 'tools' contains dependsOnPkgs() to compute reverse
        dependencies.

    o   Strict type checking is now turned on: this catches more
        internal corruptions, and some badly written contributed code.

    o   There are new functions in package 'tcltk', tk_choose.files(),
        tk_choose.dir() and tk_messageBox(), analogues of functions
        available on Windows (the last is an analogue of winDialog).

    o   Sys.glob() now does tilde expansion on all platforms.

    o   read.table() and friends gain a 'fileEncoding' argument to
        make re-encoding of input just a little bit simpler.

    o   grep() gains an 'invert' argument mimicking 'grep -v/--invert'.

    o   strwrap() now allows a separate prefix for the first line.

    o   grep() has a more efficient sibling grepl() that returns a
        logical vector.

    o   xfig() has new arguments 'defaultFont' and 'textSpecial'
        contributed by Sebastian Fischmeister.

    o   parse() and parse_Rd() now point to syntax errors in the
        reported error context, and include the filename and line and
        column numbers so smart text editors can jump to the error
        location.

    o   str(<1d-array>) now writes "[1:n(1d)]" instead of the previous
        less clear "[, 1:n]".

    o   New function testInstalledPackage() in package 'tools' allows
        the examples (and if they were installed) any package-specific
        tests to be run on an installed package.

        testInstalledPackages() can run all the examples and tests in
        the standard and/or recommended packages.  Also
        testInstalledBasic() can run the basic tests (if installed).

    o   file.copy() now has a 'recursive' argument.

    o   Errors in setOldClass() will cause a previous definition to be
restored.

    o   Ambiguities in class inheritance and method selection resulting
        from duplicates in superclasses are now resolved by requiring
        (if possible) consistency with all the superclass inheritance. The
        rules for method selection have been revised to take advantage of
        the improved ordering.
        See ?Methods and the reference there related to inheritance.

    o   New function unzip() in package 'utils' to expand or list zip
        archives.

    o   Replacement functions for class() and oldClass()  will unset
        the S4 bit when the replacement can't be an S4 object;
        oldClass() will return the S3 class for S4 objects with slot
        .S3Class.

    o   clip() takes extra steps to avoid the next graphics call
        resetting the clip region.

    o   New function sample.int() to provide documented access to the
        internal part of sample() (sampling from seq_len(n)).

    o   New version of withVisible() for better handling of cases like
        withVisible(eval.parent(....)). Moved to package 'base' with a
        view to replace .Internal(eval.with.vis) in source() later.

    o   showClass() which is also used to auto-print class definitions, now
        mentions the package where the class comes from, if there is one.

    o   simulate(obj) now also works for "glm" objects and for weighted
        fits, thanks in part to contributions from Ben Bolker and
        Heather Turner.  There is now a means to extend the methods
        available for "glm" objects, as glm families can have an
        optional 'simulate' component.

    o   S4 classes that inherit from any of the "structure" classes or
        from "vector" will turn on methods for all the "Ops" group of
        functions when the package containing the classes is
        loaded. See class?structure.

    o   A mechanism now allows S4 classes to inherit from object types
        "environment", "externalptr" and symbol ("name").  See ?setClass.

    o   demo() gains 'echo' and 'ask' arguments, with defaults similar
        to example().

    o   library() no longer checks for the packages merged during the
        re-organization of 1.9.0.

    o   New function poisson.test() in package 'stats' for exact test
        of rates and rate ratios.

    o   New function isdebugged() indicates whether its argument has the
        debug flag set or not.

    o   ls.str() [via print method] now also works when some objects in
        the environment are missing().

    o   Subsetting S4-objects (without an explicit "[" method) no longer
        preserves the class in cases like setClass("C",
        contains="list"); This reverts a "bug fix" activated in  R 2.8.0.

    o   .packages() and .find.packages() no longer check the package
        info for installed packages with dumped metadata, since this
        was checked when the package was installed.  .packages() only
        considers such packages to be validly installed (any others
        were installed in a long-obsolete version of R).  Both changes
        speed up searches in libraries of thousands of packages().

    o   boxplot() uses butt line endings for its median line
        (suggestion of Uwe Ligges, PR#13553).

    o   S4 objects passed to a non-default S3 method will be converted
        to a valid S3 object with the S3 class.  See the section on
        inheriting from non-S4 classes in ?Classes.

    o   A new class "nonStructure" has been defined; classes that extend
        a vector class but that should lose their slots under Math or
        Ops functions should extend this class.  See class?nonStructure.

    o   axis.POSIXct() now plots in the timezone marked for its inputs
        (if any) rather than in the local time.  The latter was a
        deliberate choice, but is easy to select by removing the
        'tzone' attribute.  (Suggestion of Dan Kelley.)

    o   A new function classesToAM() returns an adjacency matrix
        representing the inheritance of the classes specified.  Allows
        better human examination of the patterns, e.g. by using the
        matrix as input to one of the graph packages (see the
        documentation).

    o   X11options(antialias = "none") now works, for consistency with
        X11().

    o   sprintf() now allows zero-length arguments (with a zero-length
        result).  (Suggestion of Bill Dunlap.)

    o   unlink() is now able to remove broken symbolic links on
        Unix-alikes.

    o   New selectSuperClasses() utility.

    o   HoltWinters() now allows parameters alpha and beta to be fixed
        at 0 and hence beta = FALSE and gamma = FALSE are used to
        specify restricted models.

    o   A new function smoothScatter has been added to package
        'graphics'.  It is appropriate for very dense scatter plots
        and uses density estimation and color to reflect density of
        plotting.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   allGenerics() is defunct.

    o   Use of allocVector(CHARSXP ...) is defunct and gives an error.

    o   The compatibility define for graphics structure NewDevDesc in
        GraphicsDevice.h has been removed.

    o   Support for versioned installs (R CMD INSTALL
--with-package-versions
        and install.packages(installWithVers = TRUE)) has been removed.
        Packages installed with versioned names will be ignored.

    o   The numeric and power(0.5) forms of argument to make.link()
        which were deprecated in 2.4.0 are now defunct: use power()
        directly.

    o   Conversion to Sd and Ssgm by R CMD Rdconv is now defunct.

    o   Support for R --gui=gnome is now defunct (and package
        gnomeGUI has been withdrwan as it used a long-obsolete version
        of GNOME).

    o   R CMD SHLIB on Windows will call the first target (not 'all') in
        Makevars[.win] in future versions: so make 'all' the first
        target if you have any.


UTILITIES

    o   R CMD build now also uses a Makevars[.win] file for cleaning
        up src/.

    o   R CMD Rd2dvi and R CMD check are now able to cope with Cyrillic
        characters in UTF-8 if environment variable _R_CYRILLIC_TEX_
        is set to a non-empty value and the latex system has suitable
        fonts (thanks to a hint from Alexey Shipunov).

    o   New function rtags() in package 'utils' that provides etags-like
        indexing capabilities for R code files.

        New front-end script R CMD rtags provides an interface to the
        rtags() function (see R CMD rtags --help for details).

    o   New environment variable R_TEXI2DVICMD to hold the path (if any)
        to 'texi2dvi' found at configure time: this now provides the
        default to option("texi2dvi").

    o   massage-Examples.pl has been replaced by the R function
        tools:::massageExamples().

    o   R CMD REMOVE now uses remove.packages() and hence removes all
        members of a bundle.

    o   R CMD SHLIB is now an R script and has a new option -n aka
        --dry-run to show what commands would be run.  The same code
        is used on Unix and Windows.

    o   R CMD Rdconv has new options --package and --version to set the
        corresponding fields in HTML conversion.

    o   R CMD check runs the package tests with a custom startup file,
        currently containing 'options(useFancyQuotes = FALSE)'.

        Those tests are run by an R script: using a tests/Makefile
        (undocumented) no longer works.

    o   R CMD config now knows about DYLIB_EXT and SHLIB_EXT, for use
        in configure files.

    o   R CMD BATCH has a new option --no-timing to suppress printing
        out the session timing.

    o   R CMD Rd2dvi can now work on an installed package.

    o   R CMD check no longer loads package 'tcltk' when checking for
        code problems, so more problems may be reported.

    o   For R CMD SHLIB on Windows the default 'all' target only makes
        the DLL, and no longer call targets 'before' and 'after'.


Rd CONVERSION

    o   Rd files have an optional \Rdversion{} section, which if
        missing defaults to 1.0.  There is support for version 1.1, a
        slightly modified version with the following changes:

        - The warnings for \code{} inside example are suppressed.

        - Whitespace between arguments in \item and \section is
          accepted without a warning (see below).

        - $ is treated literally in text, even for latex conversions.

        - \ is only an escape before % { } \ .

        - \R, \dots and \ldots can be followed by {}, and it is
          recommended that they when not followed by whitespace.

        - The obsolete interpretation of \Alpha etc is no longer done.

    o   Rd conversion now handles ^ ~ < > | correctly in non-code
        environments (such as \samp), and # and _ even in latex
        conversion (but $ still needs to be escaped in version 1.0).

    o   Whitespace between first and second arguments is now accepted
        for \item and \section, e.g.  \item{foo} {some value}.
        Previously arguments after whitespace were silently ignored,
        and a warning is given for version 1.0 files.

    o   The Rd files created by prompt() and friends are declared to be
        version 1.1.

    o   \alias now supports the escaping of { as well as of %, and this
        is recommended.

    o   parse_Rd(), an experimental parser for Rd files, and Rd2txt(),
        Rd2HTML(), Rd2latex() and Rd2ex(), even more experimental
        converters, have been added to package 'tools'.

    o   R CMD check runs the package's Rd files through parse_Rd() for a
        stricter syntax check.  This can be suppressed by setting
        _R_CHECK_RD_PARSE_ to FALSE.

    o   Added markup \verb, which displays like \code, but parses as
        verbatim text.  Currently only supported by parse_Rd() and
        Rd2HTML().


INSTALLATION

    o   The shell used by the 'R' script and other shell scripts
        intended to be run directly can be specified at installation
        time by setting the (precious) configure variable R_SHELL.

    o   libtool has been updated to 2.2.6a.

    o   --with-ICU is now the default: this means that ICU will be
        used for collation on Mac OS >= 10.4.

    o   make install-tests can be used to install the test files,
        to allowed an installed version of R to be tested -- see the
        R-admin manual.  This is also supported by the function
        testInstalledPackages() in package 'tools'.

    o   'make install' using a parallel make should now work.

    o   'make check' now always re-makes and re-runs the package
        examples, which are now collated in the locale's order (and
        not ASCII order).

    o   configure will now set the default optimization level for
        gfortran on x86_64 Linux to -O as -O2 has caused problems with
        gfortran 4.3.x.


PACKAGE INSTALLATION

    o   install.packages() is able to infer that repos=NULL was
        intended from the extension on the file name specified as 'pkgs'.

        On Mac OS X it now supports local binary packages with .tar.gz
        extension. Nonetheless .tgz remains the preferred extension
        and is expected in repositories.

        It now checks >= version dependencies for dependent packages,
        and so will install a newer version of a dependency if needed
        and available on the repositories.

        The library being installed into is considered when looking
        for installed packages if it is not already part of
        .libPaths() (as INSTALL already does).

        It has a new argument 'Ncpus' to support parallel installs of
        source packages.

    o   HTML links will be resolved first to the standard packages: this
        avoids other installed packages diverting help on e.g. qr()
        and plot() to themselves. The HTML files are only "touched" if
        they have changed.

    o   A check is done that the R files can be parsed: this both
        prevents a broken package without lazy-loading from being
        installed and gives better diagnostics.

    o   install.packages() gains a 'configure.vars' argument, and both
        this and 'configure.args' get their defaults from options().

    o   There is a unified R script for INSTALL on both Unix-alike and
        Windows that takes option names used by either in the past.

        It adds --no-multiarch to disable building other than the main
        sub-architecture, and allows multiple instances of
        --configure-args and --configure-vars (which will be
        concatenated).

        New option --install-tests will install any package-specific
        tests.

    o   Times in the Packaged: and Built: fields are now recorded in
        UTC, and in most cases in ISO 8601 format.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o   A helper function, asCharacterFactor, converts from factors to
        character vectors.


BUG FIXES

    o   The postscript() output for setting text is faster and smaller.

    o   Subsetting a data frame with duplicate column names without
        selecting columns (e.g. z[i,]) no longer makes the column
        names unique.  This was never documented, but some packages
        have assumed it.

    o   data.frame() no longer ignores row names on objects if the
        first name is empty.  (PR#13230: this has been the behaviour
        for a long time, but apparently undocumented.)

    o   deparse(control="S_compatible") now never uses backticks.

    o   X-spline drawing is improved for cases where the control
        points are located well off the edges of the device.

        The symptom of this problem is the error "reached MAXNUMPTS".

    o   exists() with mode= "any" will no longer run an active binding's
        function.

    o   format(c(1 + 2i, NA)) no longer has extraneous space in "  NA".

    o   mood.test() could fail in 2.8.x on large samples because of
        integer overflow.

    o   heatmap() without a dendrogram could fail. (PR#13512)

    o   Checks for missing values will no longer occasionally result in
        an infinite loop or stack overflow error, depending on the
        compiler.  Active bindings are now always considered to be
        non-missing.

    o   Rd conversion was not accepting \p (as in \pkg} or (when using
        Perl 5.10.x) \k (as in \kbd) in any preamble text in a
        \value{} section, since those are nowadays interpreted by
        Perl.  (PR#13575)

    o   if(as.raw(1)) TRUE  now works as expected. (PR#13630)
        Also,  c(as.raw(12), TRUE) or c(raw(3), pi) do.

    o   duplicated(<data frame>, incomparables = NA) now gives the
        intended error message.

    o   name handling of as.data.frame() has been sanitized somewhat

    o   Evaluating an assignment expression with a string on the left
        hand side no longer destructively changes the string to a symbol
        in the expression.

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.8.1 patched


NEW FEATURES

    o   R CMD check has a new argument '--install-args' to pass
        command-line arguments to INSTALL.
        E.g. --install-args="--docs=normal" on Windows if the HTML
        Help Workshop is not installed.

    o   R-Forge has been added to R_HOME/etc/repositories, so it will
        be available interactively in setRepositories().

    o   The compiled loess() code has been updated to the current
        version of dloess from Netlib.  This includes patches from Ben
        Tyner which correct some errors when degree = 0 and hence
        solve PR#13570.


INSTALLATION

    o   --with-ICU is now supported (and recommended) on Mac OS X using
        Apple's supplied port.  Note however that the locale category
        LC_COLLATE cannot be changed whilst R is running on Apple's
        version of ICU.

        Configure supports a wider range of ICU versions on other
        OSes: version 3.0 should suffice, and 3.2, 3.8 and 4.0 have
        been tested.


BUG FIXES

    o   grid-based plots no longer reset the base text size to the
        default 96dpi in cairo-based bitmap devices.

    o   Rd conversion was incorrectly parsing \\\* and \\\{ (and other
        cases with an odd number of backslashes greater than one).

        Text conversion of \code{\ etc} was incorrect (a single
        backslash stands for itself inside \code).

        \code{} inside \examples{} is now fixed up (but the warning
        remains, since it will be handled incorrectly in earlier
        versions of R).

    o   as.matrix.data.frame() could fail if coercion changed the
        dimension of one of the columns (as e.g. the coercion of a "Surv"
        object to a character vector does).

    o   When extracting part of a complex list structure using [[]]
        with a vector index, the extracted part was not marked for
        duplication on change. (PR#13411)

    o   Assigning an additional element to a pairlist/language element
        by x[["foo"]] <- value did not name the additional element.

    o   .Call() and .External() were not accepting "NativeSymbolInfo"
        and "NativeSymbol" objects as claimed.  (Patch from Olaf
        Mersmann.)

    o   codoc() was missing some default value mismatches with
        unescaped backslashes, e.g. final="\\" needs to be written as
        final="\\\\" in the Rd file.

        The reports on values now give strings in the original quoted
        format (with \ and " escaped).

    o   The $<- method for pairlists (including language objects)
        failed to duplicate if NAMED was 2.

    o   read.table(blank.lines.skip = FALSE) gave a final empty row on
        files with less than 5 lines (PR#13433).

    o   Workaround for a bug in some versions of iconv that was seen
        with output lines of more than 10,000 bytes and with
        re-encoding requested on an output connection.

    o   The fullrefman.{dvi,pdf} duplicated part I in part II (at
        least on some systems).

    o   cbind() could crash with a zero-length input and a list result.

    o   pdf(colormodel = "gray") was setting the stroke colour for fills.

    o   file.show() with multiple files would only show multiple
        copies of the first one. (PR#13469)

    o   formatC(mode = "character") was documented to work, but
        did not. (PR#13474)

    o   besselI(x,.., expon.scaled=TRUE) now gives accurate results for
        x < 1e5 whereas it previously underflowed for x >~= 1500.
        Further, besselJ(x,..) also computes up to 1e5 (instead of 1e4).

    o   str() was incorrectly warning about its option component
        'formatNum' set by strOptions().

    o   nls(algorithm = "port") did not accept the [factor] notation.
        (PR#13650)

    o   The relational (aka "comparison") operators are now binary, also in
        a lower level sense, and an expression as  "<"(1)  is now erronous.

    o   The 'offset' argument for lm() and glm() is not longer
        documented to be allowed to be of length 1: this has not been
        true for a long time.

    o   format.info(x) is now also correct when x has no finite content.

    o   predict.lm() now works correctly when the fit had more than
        one offset (possibly specified both in the formula and as an
        argument).  This function is called by predict.glm(), so the
        same isses are corrected there.

    o   besselI(x, nu) with nu a negative integer (a singular case) is now
        correct. (PR#13556)

Message-ID: <4A44D917.7070202@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.9.1.tar.gz a few hours ago.

This is a maintenance release and fixes a number of mostly minor issues.

See the full list of changes below.

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.9.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.9.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   New function anyDuplicated(x) returns 0 (= FALSE) or the index
        of the first duplicated entry of x.

    o   matplot(), matlines() and matpoints() now also obey a 'lend'
        argument, determining line end styles. (Wish of PR#13619).

    o   bw.SJ(), bw.bcv() and bw.ucv() now gain an optional 'tol'
        argument allowing more accurate estimates.

    o   new.packages() no longer regards packages with the same name
        as a member of an installed bundle as 'new' (this is now
        consistent with the dependency checks in install.packages()).

        It no longer reports on partially installed bundles (since
        members can be updated individually if a bundle is unbundled).

    o   old.packages() and hence updates.packages() will look for
        updates to members of package bundles before updates to the
        whole bundle: this allow bundles to be split and installations
        updated.

    o   nlminb() gives better non-convergence messages in some cases.

    o   S3 method dispatch will support S4 class inheritance for S3
        methods, for primitives and via UseMethod(), if the argument
        S3methods=TRUE is given to setClass().  S4 method dispatch
        will use S3 per-object inheritance if S3Class() is set on the
        object.  See ?Methods and the paper referenced there.

    o   R CMD INSTALL is more tolerant of (malformed) packages with a
        'man' directory but no validly named .Rd files.

    o   R CMD check now reports where options are used that cause some
        of the checks to be skipped.

    o   RSiteSearch has been updated to be consistent with the new
        layout of the search site itself, which now includes separate
        options for vignettes, views, and r-sig-mixed-models, as well
        as changed names for r-help. (Contributed by Jonathan Baron.)

    o   That R CMD check makes use of a
        <pkg>/tests/Examples/<pkg>-Ex.Rout.save file as a reference
        result is now documented in 'Writing R Extensions'.

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   print.atomic() (defunct since 1.9.0) has been removed since it
        caused confusion for an S4 class union "atomic".

    o   png(type="cairo1") is deprecated -- it was only needed for
        platforms with 1.0 <= cairo < 1.2.

BUG FIXES

    o   The ... argument was not handled properly when ... was found
        in the enclosure of the current function, rather than in the
        function header itself.  (This caused integrate() to fail in
        certain cases.)

    o   col2rgb("#00000080", TRUE) would return the background colour.
        (Reported by Hadley Wickham.)

    o   interaction() now ensures that the levels of the result are unique.

    o   packageDescription() and hence sessionInfo() now report the correct
        package version also for a non-attached loaded namespace of
        a version different from the default lib.loc.

    o   smoothScatter() now also works when e.g. xlim[2] < xlim[1].

    o   Invalid use of sprintf() such as sprintf("%S%") now give an error
        instead of a segmentation fault, as do very unusual cases such as
        sprintf("%s", tryCatch(stop(), error=identity)).  (It was
        always documented that misuse could crash R in
        platform-dependent ways.)

    o   parse_Rd() would mishandle braces when they occurred at
        the start of a line within an R string in an Rd file (reported
        by Alex Couture-Beil) or when they occurred in an R comment
        (reported by Mark Bravington).

    o   readNEWS() missed version numbers with more than one digit.

    o   building R --without-x no longer fails (PR#13665)

    o   printCoefmat(cbind(0,1)) now works too (PR#13677)

    o   bw.SJ(c(1:99, 1e6)) now works too.

    o   Rd2txt() could not handle empty descriptions of items in an Rd
        file (reported by Mark Bravington), and did not wrap long lists
        of arguments if they were given in a single item.

    o   stars() would do a partial plot when called with plot = FALSE;
        it now consistently returns the locations of the stars.

    o   Rd2latex() could not handle empty sections.

    o   old.packages() and hence update.packages() would fail on a
        repository which contained only one package but with multiple
        versions of that package.

    o   as.character.Rd() added extra braces when displaying two-argument
        macros.  (Report and fix by Manuel Eugster.)

    o   unsplit() was misbehaving in the case of single-column data
        frames. (Reported by Will Gray.)

    o   as(I(1), "vector") and similar coercions from objects of
        "unregistered" S3 classes now work.

    o   srcref records produced by parse() and parse_Rd() did not record
        the encoding of the source file.  (Reported by Romain Francois.)

    o   The X11 version of View() was misbehaving in MBCS locales, and
        PgUp/PgDn now behave better, thanks to a patch from Ei-ji Nakama.

    o   R CMD check looked at the environment variable PDFLATEX, but
        as from R 2.8.1 R CMD Rd2dvi used R_PDFLATEXCMD in
        preference, and that was set by R CMD (and not PDFLATEX).  Now
        R CMD check looks at R_PDFLATEXCMD.

    o   sprintf() now signals an error when the result of single format
        specification would be longer than the limit (8192 bytes); it would
        return "somewhat random" results or segfault previously. (PR#13667)
        Further, arguments of type "language" or "symbol" are no longer
        allowed, as these, e.g., sprintf("%s", quote(list())), typically
        lead to unexpected results or hard to understand error messages.

    o   The new (in 2.9.0) 'stringsAsFactors' argument to expand.grid()
        was not working: it now does work but has default TRUE for
        backwards compatibility.

    o   tcrossprod(<1d-array>, <matrix>) now does work when the arguments
        are of compatible dimensions.

    o   qbinom() now is accurate also in (large size, small prob)
        cases.  (PR#13711)

    o   The calculation of the Spearman p-value in cor.test() is
        slightly more accurate in some cases.  (PR#13574)

    o   The digamma(), trigamma() and psigamma() functions could be
        inaccurate for values of x around 1e-15 due to cancellation.
        (PR#13714).

    o   median.default() was altered in 2.8.1 to use sum() rather
        than mean(), although it was still documented to use mean().
        This caused problems for POSIXt objects, for which mean() but
        not sum() makes sense, so the change has been reverted.

    o   Assigning an extra 0-length column to a data frame by
        DF$foo <- value gave a corrupt data frame rather than failing.
        (PR#13724)  This also happened for DF[["foo"]] <- value.

    o   R CMD INSTALL no longer gives a spurious warning about old R
        versions ignoring multiple dependencies, if the conditions are
        known to be satisfied.

    o   The test for setting dim() allowed a value with two or more
        NAs to be set on a 0-length object.  (PR#13729)  Also, it
        allowed an even number of negative values.

    o   xtfrm(), rank(), sort() and order() did not always make use of
        custom comparison methods specific to the class of elements
        being sorted.

    o   Increase NAMED value on 'seq' value in for() loop so loop code
        cannot modify 'seq' value.

    o   Prevent rectangles of size < 0.5 pixel from disappearing in
        Quartz when using rastered backend.  (PR#13744)

    o   Printing _NA_complex_ had a low-level thinko; patch thanks to
        Bill Dunlap.

    o   CP1257 encoding for postscript/PDF has been corrected.  (PR#13736)

    o   aov() with an error term was evaluating the ... arguments in
        2.9.0 whilst checking their names, so could fail by evaluating
        them in the wrong place.  (PR#13733)

    o   The print() method for arima() failed if all coefs were fixed.

    o   R CMD INSTALL --no-latex was not implemented in 2.9.0 (only).

    o   Added a needed PROTECT call in RunFinalizers to handle cases where
        the routine is called recursively from a GC in a finalizer.

    o   Constructing error messages about unused arguments in calls to
        closures no longer evaluates the arguments.

    o   qr(x, LAPACK=TRUE) did not coerce integer x to numeric.

    o   qr.coef() misbehaved in the LAPACK case with a matrix RHS, so
        that solve(qr(x, LAPACK=TRUE)) gave wrong results. (Found by
        Avraham Adler, PR#13762 by Ravi Varadhan.)

Subject: R 2.9.2 is released
Message-ID: <4A924F12.3070101@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.9.2.tar.gz a short while ago.

This is a maintenance release and fixes a number of mostly minor issues.

See the full list of changes below.

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.9.2.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course (Duncan Murdoch is out
of town, so Windows binaries may take a few days longer than usual).

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.9.2

NEW FEATURES

    o   install.packages(NULL) now lists packages only once even if they
        occur in more than one repository (as the latest compatible
        version of those available will always be downloaded).

    o   approxfun() and approx() now accept a 'rule' of length two, for
        easy specification of different interpolation rules on left and
        right.

        They no longer segfault for invalid zero-length specification
        of 'yleft, 'yright', or 'f'.

    o   seq_along(x) is now equivalent to seq_len(length(x)) even where
        length() has an S3/S4 method; previously it (intentionally)
        always used the default method for length().

    o   PCRE has been updated to version 7.9 (for bug fixes).

    o   agrep() uses 64-bit ints where available on 32-bit platforms
        and so may do a better job with complex matches.
        (E.g. PR#13789, which failed only on 32-bit systems.)

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   R CMD Rd2txt is deprecated, and will be removed in 2.10.0.
        (It is just a wrapper for R CMD Rdconv -t txt.)

    o   tools::Rd_parse() is deprecated and will be removed in 2.10.0
        (which will use only Rd version 2).

BUG FIXES

    o   parse_Rd() still did not handle source reference encodings
        properly.

    o   The C utility function PrintValue no longer attempts to print
        attributes for CHARSXPs as those attributes are used
        internally for the CHARSXP cache.  This fixes a segfault when
        calling it on a CHARSXP from C code.

    o   PDF graphics output was producing two instances of anything
        drawn with the symbol font face. (Report from Baptiste Auguie.)

    o   length(x) <- newval and grep() could cause memory corruption.
        (PR#13837)

    o   If model.matrix() was given too large a model, it could crash
        R. (PR#13838, fix found by Olaf Mersmann.)

    o   gzcon() (used by load()) would re-open an open connection,
        leaking a file descriptor each time. (PR#13841)

    o   The checks for inconsistent inheritance reported by setClass()
        now detect inconsistent superclasses and give better warning
        messages.

    o   print.anova() failed to recognize the column labelled
        P(>|Chi|) from a Poisson/binomial GLM anova as a p-value
        column in order to format it appropriately (and as a
        consequence it gave no significance stars).

    o   A missing PROTECT caused rare segfaults during calls to
        load().  (PR#13880, fix found by Bill Dunlap.)

    o   gsub() in a non-UTF-8 locale with a marked UTF-8 input
        could in rare circumstances overrun a buffer and so segfault.

    o   R CMD Rdconv --version was not working correctly.

    o   Missing PROTECTs in nlm() caused "random" errors. (PR#13381 by
        Adam D.I. Kramer, analysis and suggested fix by Bill Dunlap.)

    o   Some extreme cases of pbeta(log.p = TRUE) are more accurate
        (finite values < -700 rather than -Inf).  (PR#13786)

        pbeta() now reports on more cases where the asymptotic
        expansions lose accuracy (the underlying TOMS708 C code was
        ignoring some of these, including the PR#13786 example).

    o   new.env(hash = TRUE, size = NA) now works the way it has been
        documented to for a long time.

    o   tcltk::tk_choose.files(multi = TRUE) produces better-formatted
        output with filenames containing spaces.  (PR#13875)

    o   R CMD check --use-valgrind did not run valgrind on the package
tests.

    o   The tclvalue() and the print() and as.xxx methods for class
        "tclObj" crashed R with an invalid object -- seen with an
        object saved from an earlier session.

    o   R CMD BATCH garbled options -d <debugger> (useful for
        valgrind, although --debugger=valgrind always worked)

    o   INSTALL with LazyData and Encoding declared in DESCRIPTION
        might have left options("encoding") set for the rest of the
        package installation.

From P.Dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Mon Oct 26 16:20:58 2009
From: P.Dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard)
Date: Mon, 26 Oct 2009 16:20:58 +0100
Subject: R 2.9.0 is released
Message-ID: <4AE5BE5A.7000103@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.10.0.tar.gz some hours ago. This is a development
release which contains a number of new features, notably a brand new
HTML based dynamic help system.

Also, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.10.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

        For the R Core Team

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.10.0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o   Package help is now converted from Rd by the R-based converters
        that were first introduced in 2.9.0.  This means

        - Packages that were installed by R-devel after 2009-08-09
          should not be used with earlier versions of R, and most
          aspects of package help (including the runnable examples)
          will be missing if they are so used.

        - Text, HTML and latex help and examples for packages
          installed under the new system are converted on-demand from
          stored parsed Rd files.  (Conversions stored in packages
          installed under R < 2.10.0 are used if no parsed Rd files
          are found.  It is recommended that such packages be
          re-installed.)


    o   HTML help is now generated dynamically using an HTTP server
        running in the R process and listening on the loopback
        interface.

        - Those worried about security implications of such a server
          can disable it by setting the environment variable
          R_DISABLE_HTTPD to a non-empty value.  This disables
          help.start() and HTML help (so text help is shown instead).

        - The Java/Javascript search engine has been replaced by an
          HTML interface to help.search().  help.start() no longer has
          an argument 'searchEngine' as it is no longer needed.

        - The HTML help can now locate cross-references of the form
          \link[pkg]{foo} and \link[pkg:foo]{bar} where 'foo' is an
          alias in the package, rather than the documented (basename
          of a) filename (since the documentation has been much
          ignored).


NEW FEATURES

    o   polygon(), pdf() and postscript() now have a parameter
        'fillOddEven' (default FALSE), which controls the mode used for
        polygon fills of self-intersecting shapes.

    o   New debugonce() function; further,
        getOption("deparse.max.lines") is now observed when debugging,
        from a code suggestion by John Brzustowski.  (PR#13647/8)

    o   plot() methods for "stepfun" and hence "ecdf" no longer plot
        points by default for n >= 1000.

    o   [g]sub(*, perl=TRUE) now also supports '\E' in order to *end*
        \U and \L case changes, thanks to a patch from Bill Dunlap.

    o   factor(), `levels<-`(), etc, now ensure that the resulting factor
        levels are unique (as was always the implied intention).  Factors
        with duplicated levels are still constructible by low-level means,
        but are now declared illegal.

    o   New print() (S3) method for class "function", also used for
        auto-printing.  Further, .Primitive functions now print and
        auto-print identically.  The new method is based on code
        suggestions by Romain Fran?ois.

    o   The print() and toLatex() methods for class "sessionInfo" now
        show the locale in a nicer format and have arguments to
        suppress locale information.

    o   In addition to previously only round(), there are other 'Math'
        group (S3) methods for 'difftime', such as floor(), signif(),
        abs(), etc.

    o   For completeness, old.packages() and available.packages() allow
        'type' to be specified (you could always specify 'available'
        or 'contriburl').

    o   available.packages() by default only returns information on
        the latest versions of packages whose version requirements are
        satisified by the currently running R.

    o   tools::write_PACKAGES() has a new argument 'latestOnly', which
        defaults to TRUE when only the latest versions in the
        repository will be listed in the index.

    o   getOption() has a new argument 'default' that is returned if
        the specified option is not set. This simplifies querying a
        value and checking whether it is NULL or not.

    o   parse() now warns if the requested encoding is not supported.

    o   The "table" method of as.data.frame() gains a 'stringsAsFactors'
        argument to allow the classifying factors to be returned as
        character vectors rather than the default factor type.

    o   If model.frame.default() encounters a character variable where
        'xlev' indicates a factor, it now converts the variable to a
        factor (with a warning).

    o   curve() now returns a list containing the points that were drawn.

    o   spineplot() now accepts axes = FALSE, for consistency with
        other functions called by plot.factor().

    o   The Kendall and Spearman methods of cor.test() can optionally
        use continuity correction when not computing exact p-values.
        (The Kendall case is the wish of PR#13691.)

    o   R now keeps track of line numbers during execution for
        code sourced with options(keep.source = TRUE).  The source
        reference is displayed by debugging functions such as traceback(),
        browser(), recover(), and dump.frames(), and is stored as an
        attribute on each element returned by sys.calls(). [Experimental]

    o   More functions now have an implicit (S4) generic definition.

    o   quantile.default() now disallows factors (wish of PR#13631)
        and its help documents what numeric-like properties its input
        need to have to work correctly.

    o   weighted.mean() is now generic and has "Date", "POSIXct" and
        "POSIXlt" methods.

    o   Naming subscripts (e.g. x[i=1, j=2]) in data.frame methods for
        [ and [[ now gives a warning.  (Names are ignored in the
        default method, but could have odd semantics for other
        methods, and do for the data.frame ones.)

    o   as.data.frame() has an "aovproj" method.  (Wish of PR#13505)

    o   as.character(x) for numeric x no longer produces strings such as
        "0.30", i.e., with trailing zeros.  This change also renders
        levels construction in factor() more consistent.

    o   codocClasses(), which checks consistency of the documentation of
        S4 class slots, now does so in considerably more cases.  The
        documentation of inherited slots (from superclasses) is now
        optional.  This affects 'R CMD check <pkg>' when the package
        defines S4 classes.

    o   codoc() now also checks S4 methods for code/documentation
        mismatches.

    o   for(), while(), and repeat() loops  now always return NULL as
        their (invisible) value.  This change was needed to address a
        reference counting bug without creating performance penalties
        for some common use cases.

    o   The print() method for ls.str() results now obeys an optional
        'digits' argument.

    o   The 'method' argument of glm() now allows user-contributed methods.

    o   More general reorder.default() replaces functionality of
        reorder.factor() and reorder.character().

    o   The function aspell() has been added to provide an interface to
        the Aspell spell-checker.

    o   Filters RdTextFilter() and SweaveTeXFilter() have been added
        to the tools package to provide support for aspell() or other
        spell checkers.

    o   xtabs() with the new option 'sparse = TRUE' now returns a sparse
        Matrix, using package 'Matrix'.

    o   contr.sum() etc gain an argument 'sparse' which allows sparse
        matrices to be returned.

        contrasts() also gains a 'sparse' argument which it passes to the
        actual contrast function if that has a formal argument 'sparse'.

        'contrasts(f, .) <- val' now also works when 'val' is a sparse
        Matrix.  It is planned that model.matrix() will work with such
        factors 'f' in the future.

    o   readNEWS() will recognize a UTF-8 byte-order mark (BOM) in the
        NEWS file. However, it is safer to use only ASCII code there
        because not all editors recognize BOMs.

    o   New utility function inheritedSlotNames() for S4 class programming.

    o   tabulate() now allows NAs to pass through (and be ignored).

    o   If debug() is called on an S3 generic function then all methods
        are debugged as well.

    o   Outlier symbols drawn by boxplot() now obey the 'outlwd'
        argument.  Reported by Jurgen Kluge.

    o   svd(x) and eigen(x) now behave analogously to qr(x) in
        accepting logical matrices x.

    o   File NEWS is now in UTF-8, and has a BOM (often invisible) on
        the first line, and Emacs local variables set for UTF-8 at the
        end.  RShowDoc("NEWS") should display this correctly, given
        suitable fonts.

    o   terms.formula(simplify = TRUE) now does not deparse the LHS and
        so preserves non-standard responses such as `a: b` (requested
        by Sundar Dorai-Raj).

    o   New function news() for building and querying R or package news
        information.

    o   z^n for integer n and complex z is more accurate now if
        |n| <= 65536.

    o   factor(NULL) now returns the same as factor(character(0))
        instead of an error, and table(NULL) consequently does
        analogously.

    o   as.data.frame.vector() (and its copies) is slightly faster
        by avoiding a copy if there are no names (following a
        suggestion of Tim Hesterberg).

    o   writeLines(), writeBin() and writeChar() have a new argument
        'useBytes'.  If false, character strings with marked encodings
        are translated to the current locale (as before) but if true
        they are written byte-by-byte.

    o   iconv() has a new argument 'mark' which can be used (by
        experts) to suppress the declaration of encodings.

    o   DESCRIPTION 'LinkingTo' specs are now recognized as installation
        dependencies, and included in package management computations.

    o   Standardized DESCRIPTION 'License' specs are now available for
        package management computations.

    o   "\uxxxx" and "\Uxxxxxxxx" escapes can now be parsed to a UTF-8
        encoded string even in non-UTF-8 locales (this has been
        implemented on Windows since R 2.7.0).  The semantics have
        been changed slightly: a string containing such escapes is
        always stored in UTF-8 (and hence is suitable for portably
        including Unicode text in packages).

    o   New as.raw() method for "tclObj" objects (wish of PR#13578).

    o   Rd.sty now makes a better job of setting email addresses,
        including using a monospaced font.

    o   textConnection() gains an 'encoding' argument to determine how
        input strings with marked encodings will be handled.

    o   R CMD Rd2pdf is available as a shortcut for R CMD Rd2dvi --pdf.

    o   R CMD check now checks links where a package is specified
        (\link[pkg]{file} or \link[pkg:file]{topic}), if the package
        is available.  It notes if the package is not available, as in
        many cases this is an error in the link.

    o   identical() gains three logical arguments, which allow for even
        more differentiation, notably '-0' and '0'.

    o   legend() now can specify the 'border' color of filled boxes,
        thanks to a patch from Frederic Schutz.

    o   Indexing with a vector index to [[]] has now been extended to
        all recursive types.

    o   Pairlists may now be assigned as elements of lists.  (Lists
        could always be created with pairlist elements, but [[<-
        didn't support assigning them.)

    o   The parser now supports C-preprocessor-like #line directives,
        so error messages and source references may refer to the original
        file rather than an intermediate one.

    o   New functions findLineNum() and setBreakpoint() work with the
        source references to find the location of source lines and set
        breakpoints (using trace()) at those lines.

    o   Namespace importing is more careful about warning on masked
        generics, thanks to a patch by Yohan Chalabi.

    o   detach() now has an argument 'character.only' with the same
        meaning as for library() or require().

    o   available.packages() gains a 'filters' argument for specifying
        the filtering operations performed on the packages found in the
        repositories.  A new built-in 'license/FOSS' filter only
        retains packages for which installation can proceed solely based
        on packages which can be verified as Free or Open Source
        Software (FOSS) employing the available license specifications.

    o   In registering an S3 class by a call to setOldClass(), the data
        part (e.g., the object type) required for the class can be
        included as one of the superclasses in the Classes argument.

    o   The argument 'f' to showMethods() can be an expression evaluating
        to a generic function, allowing methods to be shown for
        non-exported generics and other nonstandard cases.

    o   sprintf() now supports '%o' for octal conversions.

    o   New function Sys.readlink() for information about symbolic
        links, including if a file is a symbolic link.

    o   Package 'tools' has new functions checkRdaFiles() and
        resaveRdaFiles() to report on the format of .rda/.RData data
        files, and to re-save them in a different compressed format,
        including choosing the most compact format available.

        A new INSTALL option, --resave-data, makes use of this.

    o   File ~/.R/config is used in preference to ~/.Rconfig, and
        these are now documented in 'R Installation and Administration'.

    o   Logic operations with complex numbers now work, as they were always
        documented to, and as in S.

    o   arrows() and segments() allow one of x1 or y1 to be omitted to
        simplify the specification of vertical or horizontal lines
        (suggestion of Tim Hesterberg).

    o   approxfun() is faster by avoiding repeated NA checks (diagnosis
        and patch by Karline Soetaert & Thomas Petzoldt).

    o   There are the beginnings of a Nynorsk translation by Karl Ove
        Hufthammer.

    o   stripchart() allows par 'bg' to be passed in for the
        background colour for pch = 21 (wish of PR#13984).

    o   New generic function .DollarNames() to enable class authors
        to customize completion after the $ extractor.

    o   load(), save(), dput() and dump() now open a not-yet-open
        connection in the appropriate mode (as other functions using
        connections directly already did).


REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

    o   A different regular expression engine is used for basic and
        extended regexps and is also for approximate matching.  This is
        based on the TRE library of Ville Laurikari, a modifed copy of
        which is included in the R sources.

        This is often faster, especially in a MBCS locale.

        Some known differences are that it is less tolerant of invalid
        inputs in MBCS locales, and in its interpretation of undefined
        (extended) regexps such as "^*".  Also, the interpretation of
        ranges such as [W-z] in caseless matching is no longer to map
        the range to lower case.

        This engine may in future be used in 'literal' mode for fixed
        = TRUE, and there is a compile-time option in src/main/grep.c
        to do so.

    o   The use of repeated boundary regexps in gsub() and gregexpr() as
        warned about in the help page does not work in this engine (it
        did in the previous one since 2005).

    o   Extended (and basic) regexps now support same set of options as
        for fixed = TRUE and perl = TRUE, including 'useBytes' and
        support for UTF-8-encoded strings in non-UTF-8 locales.

    o   agrep() now has full support for MBCS locales with a modest
        speed penalty.  This enables help.search() to use approximate
        matching character-wise rather than byte-wise.

    o   [g]sub use a single-pass algorithm instead of matching twice
        and so is usually faster.

    o   The perl = TRUE versions now work correctly in a non-UTF-8 MBCS
        locale, by translating the inputs to UTF-8.

    o   useBytes = TRUE now inhibits the translation of inputs with
        marked encodings.

    o   strsplit() gains a 'useBytes' argument.

    o   The algorithm used by strsplit() has been reordered to batch by
        elements of 'split': this can be much faster for fixed = FALSE
        (as multiple compilation of regexps is avoided).

    o   The help pages, including ?regexp, have been updated and
        should be consulted for details of the new implementations.


HELP & Rd FILE CHANGES

    o   A new dynamic HTML help system is used by default, and may be
        controlled using tools::startDynamicHelp().  With this enabled,
        HTML help pages will be generated on request, resolving links
        by searching through the current .libPaths().  The user
        may set option("help.ports") to control which IP port is used
        by the server.

    o   help.start() no longer sets options(htmlhelp = TRUE) (it used
        to on Unix but not on Windows).  Nor does it on Unix reset the
        "browser" option if given an argument of that name.

        Arguments 'update' and 'remote' are now available on all
        platforms: the default is update = FALSE since the http server
        will update the package index at first use.

    o   help() has a new argument 'help_type' (with default set by the
        option of that name) to supersede 'offline', 'htmlhelp' and
        'chmhelp' (although for now they still work if 'help_type' is
        unset).  There is a new type, "PDF" to allow offline PDF
        (rather than PostScript).

        A function offline_help_helper() will be used if this exists
        in the workspace or further down the search path, otherwise
        the function of that name in the 'utils' name space is used.

    o   Plain text help is now used as the fallback for HTML help (as
        it always was for Compiled HTML help on Windows).

    o   It is possible to ask for static HTML pages to be prebuilt via
        the configure option --enable-prebuilt-html.  This may be
        useful for those who wish to make HTML help available outside
        R, e.g. on a local web site.

    o   An experimental tag \Sexpr has been added to Rd files, to
        evaluate expressions at build, install, or render time.
        Currently install time and render time evaluation are
        supported.

    o   Tags \if, \ifelse and \out have been added to allow
        format-specific (or more general, using \Sexpr) conditional
        text in man pages.

    o   The parse_Rd() parser has been made more tolerant of coding
        errors in Rd files:  now all syntax errors are reported as
        warnings, and an attempt is made to continue parsing.

    o   parse_Rd() now has an argument 'fragment' (default FALSE) to
        accept small fragments of Rd files (so that \Sexpr can output
        Rd code which is then parsed).

    o   parse_Rd() now always converts its input to UTF-8.  The Rd2*
        rendering functions have a new parameter, 'outputEncoding',
        which controls how their output is encoded.

    o   parse_Rd() no longer includes the newline as part of a
        "%"-style comment.

    o   There have been various bug fixes and code reorganization in
        the Rd renderers Rd2HTML, Rd2latex, Rd2txt, and Rd2ex.

        All example files are now created with either ASCII or UTF-8
        encoding, and the encoding is only marked in the file if there
        is any non-UTF-8 code (previously it was marked if the help
        file had non-ASCII contents, possibly in other sections).

    o   print.Rd() now adds necessary escape characters so that
        printing and re-parsing an Rd object should produce an
        equivalent object.

    o   parse_Rd() was incorrectly handling multiple backslashes in
        R code strings, converting 4n+3 backslashes to 2n+1 instead
        of 2n+2.

    o   parse_Rd() now recognizes the \var tag within a quoted string
        in R-like text.

    o   parse_Rd() now treats the argument of \command as LaTeX-like,
        rather than verbatim.


COMPRESSION

    o   New function untar() to list or unpack tar archives, possibly
        compressed.  This uses either an external 'tar' command or an
        internal implementation.

    o   New function tar() to create (possibly compressed) tar archives.

    o   New functions memCompress() and memDecompress() for in-memory
        compression and decompression.

    o   bzfile() has a 'compress' argument to select the amount of
        effort put into compression when writing.

    o   New function xzfile() for use with xz-compressed files.  (This
        can also read files compressed by some versions of 'lzma'.)

    o   gzfile() looks at the file header and so can now also read
        bzip2-ed files and xz-compressed files.

    o   There are the new options of save(compress = "bzip2") and "xz"
        to use bzip2 or xz compression (which will be slower, but can
        give substantially smaller files).  Argument compression_level
        gives finer control over the space/time tradeoffs.

        load() can read such saves (but only as from this version of R).

    o   R CMD INSTALL/check and tools::writePACKAGES accept a wider
        range of compressed tar archives.  Precisely how wide depends
        on the capabilities of the host system's 'tar' command: they
        almost always include .tar.bz2 archives, and with modern
        versions of 'tar' other forms of compression such as lzma and
        xz, and arbitrary extensions.

    o   R CMD INSTALL has a new option --data-compress to control the
        compression used when lazy-loading data.  New possibilities are
        --data-compress=bzip2 which will give ca 15% better
        compression at the expense of slower installation times, and
        --data-compress=xz, often giving even better compression on
        large datasets at the expense of much longer installation
        times.  (The latter is used for the recommended packages: it is
        particularly effective for 'survival'.)

    o   file() for open = "", "r" or "rt" will automagically detect
        compressed files (from gzip, bzip2 or xz).  This means that
        compressed files can be specified by file name (rather than
        via a gzfile() connection) to read.table(), readlines(),
        scan() and so on.

    o   data() can handle compressed text files with extensions
        .{txt,tab,csv}.{gz,bz2,xz} .


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   png(type="cairo1") is defunct: the value is no longer recognized.

    o   tools::Rd_parse() is defunct (as this version of R uses only
        Rd version 2).

    o   Use of ~/.Rconf (which was deprecated in favour of ~/.Rconfig
        in 2004) has finally been removed.

    o   Bundles of packages are deprecated.  See 'Writing R
        Extensions' for the steps needed to unbundle a bundle.

    o   help() arguments 'offline', 'htmlhelp' and 'chmhelp' are
        deprecated in favour of 'help_type'.

    o   clearNames() ('stats') is deprecated for unname().

    o   Basic regular expressions (extended = FALSE) are deprecated in
        strsplit, grep and friends.  There is a precise POSIX standard
        for them, but it is not what recent RE engines implement, and
        it seems that in almost all cases package authors intended
        fixed = TRUE when using extended = FALSE.

    o   methods::trySilent() is deprecated for  try(*, silent=TRUE) or
        - more efficiently and flexibly - something like
        tryCatch(*, error = function(e) e).

    o   index.search() is deprecated: there are no longer directories of
        types other than 'help'.


INSTALLATION

    o   cairo >= 1.2 is now required (1.2.0 was released in July 2006)
        for cairo-based graphics devices (which remain optional).

    o   A suitable iconv() is now required: support for configure option
        --without-iconv has been withdrawn (it was deprecated in R 2.5.0).

    o   Perl is no longer 'essential'.  R can be built without it, but
        scripts R CMD build, check, Rprof and Sd2d require it.

    o   A system 'glob' function is now essential (a working
        Sys.glob() has been assumed since R 2.9.0 at least).

    o   C99 support for MBCS is now required, and configure option
        --disable-mbcs has been withdrawn.

    o   Having a version of 'tar' capable of automagically detecting
        compressed archives is useful for utils::untar(), and so 'gtar'
        (a common name for GNU tar) is preferred to 'tar': set
        environment variable TAR to specify a particular 'tar' command.


INTERNATIONALIZATION

    o   There is some makefile support for adding/updating translations
        in packages: see po/README and 'Writing R Extensions'.

        There is support for the use of 'dngettext' for C-level
        translations in packages: see 'Writing R Extensions'.


BUG FIXES

    o   Assigning an extra 0-length column to a data frame by
        DF[, "foo"] <- value now works in most cases (by filling with
        NAs) or fails.  (It used to give a corrupt data frame.)

    o   validObject() avoids an error during evaluation in the case
        of various incorrect slot definitions.

    o   n:m now returns a result of type "integer" in a few more
        boundary cases.

    o   The 'zap.ind' argument to printCoefmat() did not usually work as
        other code attempted to ensure that non-zero values had a
        non-zero representation.

    o   printCoefmat() formatted groups of columns together, not just
        the cs.ind group but also the zap.ind group and a residual
        group.  It now formats all columns except the cs.ind group
        separately (and zaps the zap.ind group column-by-column).  The
        main effect will be see in the output from print.anova, as
        this grouped SS-like columns in the zap.ind group.

    o   R_ReplDLLinit() initializes the top-level jump so that some
        embedded applications on Windows no longer crash on error.

    o   identical() failed to take the encoding of character strings
        into account, so identical byte patterns are not necessarily
        identical strings, and similarly Latin-1 and UTF-8 versions of
        the same string differ in byte pattern.

    o   methods(f) used to warn unnecessarily for an S4 generic 'f' which
        had been created based on an existing S3 generic.

    o   The check for consistent ordering of superclasses was not
        ignoring all conditional relations (the symptom was usually
        spurious warnings for classes extending "array").

    o   Trying to assign into a raw vector with an index vector
        containing NAs could cause a segfault.  Reported by Herv? Pag?s.

    o   Rscript could segfault if (by user error) its filename argument
        was missing.  Reported by Martin Morgan.

    o   getAnywhere() (and functions that use it, including argument
        completion in the console) did not handle special built-in
        functions.  Reported by Romain Francois.

    o   order() was missing a PROTECT() call and so could segfault when
        called on character data under certain (rare) circumstances
        involving marked non-native encodings.

    o   prettyNum(z, drop0trailing=TRUE) did not work correctly when z
        was a complex vector.  Consequently, str(z, ...)  also did
        not.  (PR#13985)

    o   'make distclean' removed too many files in etc/ if
        builddir = srcdir.

    o   R CMD replaced TEXINPUTS rather than appending to it (as
        documented and intended).

    o   help.start() no longer fails on unix when "browser" is a
        function.

    o   pbeta(x, *, log.p = TRUE) is sometimes more accurate, e.g., for
        very small x.

    o   Unserializing a pre-2.8 workspace containing pure ASCII character
        objects with a LATIN1 or UTF-8 encoding would corrupt the CHARSXP
        cache.

Subject: R 2.10.0 is released
Message-ID: <4AE5C069.7020403@biostat.ku.dk>

(D'oh. Forgot to change the Subject: line...)

I've rolled up R-2.10.0.tar.gz some hours ago. This is a development
release which contains a number of new features, notably a brand new
HTML based dynamic help system.

Also, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.10.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.10.0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o   Package help is now converted from Rd by the R-based converters
        that were first introduced in 2.9.0.  This means

        - Packages that were installed by R-devel after 2009-08-09
          should not be used with earlier versions of R, and most
          aspects of package help (including the runnable examples)
          will be missing if they are so used.

        - Text, HTML and latex help and examples for packages
          installed under the new system are converted on-demand from
          stored parsed Rd files.  (Conversions stored in packages
          installed under R < 2.10.0 are used if no parsed Rd files
          are found.  It is recommended that such packages be
          re-installed.)


    o   HTML help is now generated dynamically using an HTTP server
        running in the R process and listening on the loopback
        interface.

        - Those worried about security implications of such a server
          can disable it by setting the environment variable
          R_DISABLE_HTTPD to a non-empty value.  This disables
          help.start() and HTML help (so text help is shown instead).

        - The Java/Javascript search engine has been replaced by an
          HTML interface to help.search().  help.start() no longer has
          an argument 'searchEngine' as it is no longer needed.

        - The HTML help can now locate cross-references of the form
          \link[pkg]{foo} and \link[pkg:foo]{bar} where 'foo' is an
          alias in the package, rather than the documented (basename
          of a) filename (since the documentation has been much
          ignored).


NEW FEATURES

    o   polygon(), pdf() and postscript() now have a parameter
        'fillOddEven' (default FALSE), which controls the mode used for
        polygon fills of self-intersecting shapes.

    o   New debugonce() function; further,
        getOption("deparse.max.lines") is now observed when debugging,
        from a code suggestion by John Brzustowski.  (PR#13647/8)

    o   plot() methods for "stepfun" and hence "ecdf" no longer plot
        points by default for n >= 1000.

    o   [g]sub(*, perl=TRUE) now also supports '\E' in order to *end*
        \U and \L case changes, thanks to a patch from Bill Dunlap.

    o   factor(), `levels<-`(), etc, now ensure that the resulting factor
        levels are unique (as was always the implied intention).  Factors
        with duplicated levels are still constructible by low-level means,
        but are now declared illegal.

    o   New print() (S3) method for class "function", also used for
        auto-printing.  Further, .Primitive functions now print and
        auto-print identically.  The new method is based on code
        suggestions by Romain Fran?ois.

    o   The print() and toLatex() methods for class "sessionInfo" now
        show the locale in a nicer format and have arguments to
        suppress locale information.

    o   In addition to previously only round(), there are other 'Math'
        group (S3) methods for 'difftime', such as floor(), signif(),
        abs(), etc.

    o   For completeness, old.packages() and available.packages() allow
        'type' to be specified (you could always specify 'available'
        or 'contriburl').

    o   available.packages() by default only returns information on
        the latest versions of packages whose version requirements are
        satisified by the currently running R.

    o   tools::write_PACKAGES() has a new argument 'latestOnly', which
        defaults to TRUE when only the latest versions in the
        repository will be listed in the index.

    o   getOption() has a new argument 'default' that is returned if
        the specified option is not set. This simplifies querying a
        value and checking whether it is NULL or not.

    o   parse() now warns if the requested encoding is not supported.

    o   The "table" method of as.data.frame() gains a 'stringsAsFactors'
        argument to allow the classifying factors to be returned as
        character vectors rather than the default factor type.

    o   If model.frame.default() encounters a character variable where
        'xlev' indicates a factor, it now converts the variable to a
        factor (with a warning).

    o   curve() now returns a list containing the points that were drawn.

    o   spineplot() now accepts axes = FALSE, for consistency with
        other functions called by plot.factor().

    o   The Kendall and Spearman methods of cor.test() can optionally
        use continuity correction when not computing exact p-values.
        (The Kendall case is the wish of PR#13691.)

    o   R now keeps track of line numbers during execution for
        code sourced with options(keep.source = TRUE).  The source
        reference is displayed by debugging functions such as traceback(),
        browser(), recover(), and dump.frames(), and is stored as an
        attribute on each element returned by sys.calls(). [Experimental]

    o   More functions now have an implicit (S4) generic definition.

    o   quantile.default() now disallows factors (wish of PR#13631)
        and its help documents what numeric-like properties its input
        need to have to work correctly.

    o   weighted.mean() is now generic and has "Date", "POSIXct" and
        "POSIXlt" methods.

    o   Naming subscripts (e.g. x[i=1, j=2]) in data.frame methods for
        [ and [[ now gives a warning.  (Names are ignored in the
        default method, but could have odd semantics for other
        methods, and do for the data.frame ones.)

    o   as.data.frame() has an "aovproj" method.  (Wish of PR#13505)

    o   as.character(x) for numeric x no longer produces strings such as
        "0.30", i.e., with trailing zeros.  This change also renders
        levels construction in factor() more consistent.

    o   codocClasses(), which checks consistency of the documentation of
        S4 class slots, now does so in considerably more cases.  The
        documentation of inherited slots (from superclasses) is now
        optional.  This affects 'R CMD check <pkg>' when the package
        defines S4 classes.

    o   codoc() now also checks S4 methods for code/documentation
        mismatches.

    o   for(), while(), and repeat() loops  now always return NULL as
        their (invisible) value.  This change was needed to address a
        reference counting bug without creating performance penalties
        for some common use cases.

    o   The print() method for ls.str() results now obeys an optional
        'digits' argument.

    o   The 'method' argument of glm() now allows user-contributed methods.

    o   More general reorder.default() replaces functionality of
        reorder.factor() and reorder.character().

    o   The function aspell() has been added to provide an interface to
        the Aspell spell-checker.

    o   Filters RdTextFilter() and SweaveTeXFilter() have been added
        to the tools package to provide support for aspell() or other
        spell checkers.

    o   xtabs() with the new option 'sparse = TRUE' now returns a sparse
        Matrix, using package 'Matrix'.

    o   contr.sum() etc gain an argument 'sparse' which allows sparse
        matrices to be returned.

        contrasts() also gains a 'sparse' argument which it passes to the
        actual contrast function if that has a formal argument 'sparse'.

        'contrasts(f, .) <- val' now also works when 'val' is a sparse
        Matrix.  It is planned that model.matrix() will work with such
        factors 'f' in the future.

    o   readNEWS() will recognize a UTF-8 byte-order mark (BOM) in the
        NEWS file. However, it is safer to use only ASCII code there
        because not all editors recognize BOMs.

    o   New utility function inheritedSlotNames() for S4 class programming.

    o   tabulate() now allows NAs to pass through (and be ignored).

    o   If debug() is called on an S3 generic function then all methods
        are debugged as well.

    o   Outlier symbols drawn by boxplot() now obey the 'outlwd'
        argument.  Reported by Jurgen Kluge.

    o   svd(x) and eigen(x) now behave analogously to qr(x) in
        accepting logical matrices x.

    o   File NEWS is now in UTF-8, and has a BOM (often invisible) on
        the first line, and Emacs local variables set for UTF-8 at the
        end.  RShowDoc("NEWS") should display this correctly, given
        suitable fonts.

    o   terms.formula(simplify = TRUE) now does not deparse the LHS and
        so preserves non-standard responses such as `a: b` (requested
        by Sundar Dorai-Raj).

    o   New function news() for building and querying R or package news
        information.

    o   z^n for integer n and complex z is more accurate now if
        |n| <= 65536.

    o   factor(NULL) now returns the same as factor(character(0))
        instead of an error, and table(NULL) consequently does
        analogously.

    o   as.data.frame.vector() (and its copies) is slightly faster
        by avoiding a copy if there are no names (following a
        suggestion of Tim Hesterberg).

    o   writeLines(), writeBin() and writeChar() have a new argument
        'useBytes'.  If false, character strings with marked encodings
        are translated to the current locale (as before) but if true
        they are written byte-by-byte.

    o   iconv() has a new argument 'mark' which can be used (by
        experts) to suppress the declaration of encodings.

    o   DESCRIPTION 'LinkingTo' specs are now recognized as installation
        dependencies, and included in package management computations.

    o   Standardized DESCRIPTION 'License' specs are now available for
        package management computations.

    o   "\uxxxx" and "\Uxxxxxxxx" escapes can now be parsed to a UTF-8
        encoded string even in non-UTF-8 locales (this has been
        implemented on Windows since R 2.7.0).  The semantics have
        been changed slightly: a string containing such escapes is
        always stored in UTF-8 (and hence is suitable for portably
        including Unicode text in packages).

    o   New as.raw() method for "tclObj" objects (wish of PR#13578).

    o   Rd.sty now makes a better job of setting email addresses,
        including using a monospaced font.

    o   textConnection() gains an 'encoding' argument to determine how
        input strings with marked encodings will be handled.

    o   R CMD Rd2pdf is available as a shortcut for R CMD Rd2dvi --pdf.

    o   R CMD check now checks links where a package is specified
        (\link[pkg]{file} or \link[pkg:file]{topic}), if the package
        is available.  It notes if the package is not available, as in
        many cases this is an error in the link.

    o   identical() gains three logical arguments, which allow for even
        more differentiation, notably '-0' and '0'.

    o   legend() now can specify the 'border' color of filled boxes,
        thanks to a patch from Frederic Schutz.

    o   Indexing with a vector index to [[]] has now been extended to
        all recursive types.

    o   Pairlists may now be assigned as elements of lists.  (Lists
        could always be created with pairlist elements, but [[<-
        didn't support assigning them.)

    o   The parser now supports C-preprocessor-like #line directives,
        so error messages and source references may refer to the original
        file rather than an intermediate one.

    o   New functions findLineNum() and setBreakpoint() work with the
        source references to find the location of source lines and set
        breakpoints (using trace()) at those lines.

    o   Namespace importing is more careful about warning on masked
        generics, thanks to a patch by Yohan Chalabi.

    o   detach() now has an argument 'character.only' with the same
        meaning as for library() or require().

    o   available.packages() gains a 'filters' argument for specifying
        the filtering operations performed on the packages found in the
        repositories.  A new built-in 'license/FOSS' filter only
        retains packages for which installation can proceed solely based
        on packages which can be verified as Free or Open Source
        Software (FOSS) employing the available license specifications.

    o   In registering an S3 class by a call to setOldClass(), the data
        part (e.g., the object type) required for the class can be
        included as one of the superclasses in the Classes argument.

    o   The argument 'f' to showMethods() can be an expression evaluating
        to a generic function, allowing methods to be shown for
        non-exported generics and other nonstandard cases.

    o   sprintf() now supports '%o' for octal conversions.

    o   New function Sys.readlink() for information about symbolic
        links, including if a file is a symbolic link.

    o   Package 'tools' has new functions checkRdaFiles() and
        resaveRdaFiles() to report on the format of .rda/.RData data
        files, and to re-save them in a different compressed format,
        including choosing the most compact format available.

        A new INSTALL option, --resave-data, makes use of this.

    o   File ~/.R/config is used in preference to ~/.Rconfig, and
        these are now documented in 'R Installation and Administration'.

    o   Logic operations with complex numbers now work, as they were always
        documented to, and as in S.

    o   arrows() and segments() allow one of x1 or y1 to be omitted to
        simplify the specification of vertical or horizontal lines
        (suggestion of Tim Hesterberg).

    o   approxfun() is faster by avoiding repeated NA checks (diagnosis
        and patch by Karline Soetaert & Thomas Petzoldt).

    o   There are the beginnings of a Nynorsk translation by Karl Ove
        Hufthammer.

    o   stripchart() allows par 'bg' to be passed in for the
        background colour for pch = 21 (wish of PR#13984).

    o   New generic function .DollarNames() to enable class authors
        to customize completion after the $ extractor.

    o   load(), save(), dput() and dump() now open a not-yet-open
        connection in the appropriate mode (as other functions using
        connections directly already did).


REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

    o   A different regular expression engine is used for basic and
        extended regexps and is also for approximate matching.  This is
        based on the TRE library of Ville Laurikari, a modifed copy of
        which is included in the R sources.

        This is often faster, especially in a MBCS locale.

        Some known differences are that it is less tolerant of invalid
        inputs in MBCS locales, and in its interpretation of undefined
        (extended) regexps such as "^*".  Also, the interpretation of
        ranges such as [W-z] in caseless matching is no longer to map
        the range to lower case.

        This engine may in future be used in 'literal' mode for fixed
        = TRUE, and there is a compile-time option in src/main/grep.c
        to do so.

    o   The use of repeated boundary regexps in gsub() and gregexpr() as
        warned about in the help page does not work in this engine (it
        did in the previous one since 2005).

    o   Extended (and basic) regexps now support same set of options as
        for fixed = TRUE and perl = TRUE, including 'useBytes' and
        support for UTF-8-encoded strings in non-UTF-8 locales.

    o   agrep() now has full support for MBCS locales with a modest
        speed penalty.  This enables help.search() to use approximate
        matching character-wise rather than byte-wise.

    o   [g]sub use a single-pass algorithm instead of matching twice
        and so is usually faster.

    o   The perl = TRUE versions now work correctly in a non-UTF-8 MBCS
        locale, by translating the inputs to UTF-8.

    o   useBytes = TRUE now inhibits the translation of inputs with
        marked encodings.

    o   strsplit() gains a 'useBytes' argument.

    o   The algorithm used by strsplit() has been reordered to batch by
        elements of 'split': this can be much faster for fixed = FALSE
        (as multiple compilation of regexps is avoided).

    o   The help pages, including ?regexp, have been updated and
        should be consulted for details of the new implementations.


HELP & Rd FILE CHANGES

    o   A new dynamic HTML help system is used by default, and may be
        controlled using tools::startDynamicHelp().  With this enabled,
        HTML help pages will be generated on request, resolving links
        by searching through the current .libPaths().  The user
        may set option("help.ports") to control which IP port is used
        by the server.

    o   help.start() no longer sets options(htmlhelp = TRUE) (it used
        to on Unix but not on Windows).  Nor does it on Unix reset the
        "browser" option if given an argument of that name.

        Arguments 'update' and 'remote' are now available on all
        platforms: the default is update = FALSE since the http server
        will update the package index at first use.

    o   help() has a new argument 'help_type' (with default set by the
        option of that name) to supersede 'offline', 'htmlhelp' and
        'chmhelp' (although for now they still work if 'help_type' is
        unset).  There is a new type, "PDF" to allow offline PDF
        (rather than PostScript).

        A function offline_help_helper() will be used if this exists
        in the workspace or further down the search path, otherwise
        the function of that name in the 'utils' name space is used.

    o   Plain text help is now used as the fallback for HTML help (as
        it always was for Compiled HTML help on Windows).

    o   It is possible to ask for static HTML pages to be prebuilt via
        the configure option --enable-prebuilt-html.  This may be
        useful for those who wish to make HTML help available outside
        R, e.g. on a local web site.

    o   An experimental tag \Sexpr has been added to Rd files, to
        evaluate expressions at build, install, or render time.
        Currently install time and render time evaluation are
        supported.

    o   Tags \if, \ifelse and \out have been added to allow
        format-specific (or more general, using \Sexpr) conditional
        text in man pages.

    o   The parse_Rd() parser has been made more tolerant of coding
        errors in Rd files:  now all syntax errors are reported as
        warnings, and an attempt is made to continue parsing.

    o   parse_Rd() now has an argument 'fragment' (default FALSE) to
        accept small fragments of Rd files (so that \Sexpr can output
        Rd code which is then parsed).

    o   parse_Rd() now always converts its input to UTF-8.  The Rd2*
        rendering functions have a new parameter, 'outputEncoding',
        which controls how their output is encoded.

    o   parse_Rd() no longer includes the newline as part of a
        "%"-style comment.

    o   There have been various bug fixes and code reorganization in
        the Rd renderers Rd2HTML, Rd2latex, Rd2txt, and Rd2ex.

        All example files are now created with either ASCII or UTF-8
        encoding, and the encoding is only marked in the file if there
        is any non-UTF-8 code (previously it was marked if the help
        file had non-ASCII contents, possibly in other sections).

    o   print.Rd() now adds necessary escape characters so that
        printing and re-parsing an Rd object should produce an
        equivalent object.

    o   parse_Rd() was incorrectly handling multiple backslashes in
        R code strings, converting 4n+3 backslashes to 2n+1 instead
        of 2n+2.

    o   parse_Rd() now recognizes the \var tag within a quoted string
        in R-like text.

    o   parse_Rd() now treats the argument of \command as LaTeX-like,
        rather than verbatim.


COMPRESSION

    o   New function untar() to list or unpack tar archives, possibly
        compressed.  This uses either an external 'tar' command or an
        internal implementation.

    o   New function tar() to create (possibly compressed) tar archives.

    o   New functions memCompress() and memDecompress() for in-memory
        compression and decompression.

    o   bzfile() has a 'compress' argument to select the amount of
        effort put into compression when writing.

    o   New function xzfile() for use with xz-compressed files.  (This
        can also read files compressed by some versions of 'lzma'.)

    o   gzfile() looks at the file header and so can now also read
        bzip2-ed files and xz-compressed files.

    o   There are the new options of save(compress = "bzip2") and "xz"
        to use bzip2 or xz compression (which will be slower, but can
        give substantially smaller files).  Argument compression_level
        gives finer control over the space/time tradeoffs.

        load() can read such saves (but only as from this version of R).

    o   R CMD INSTALL/check and tools::writePACKAGES accept a wider
        range of compressed tar archives.  Precisely how wide depends
        on the capabilities of the host system's 'tar' command: they
        almost always include .tar.bz2 archives, and with modern
        versions of 'tar' other forms of compression such as lzma and
        xz, and arbitrary extensions.

    o   R CMD INSTALL has a new option --data-compress to control the
        compression used when lazy-loading data.  New possibilities are
        --data-compress=bzip2 which will give ca 15% better
        compression at the expense of slower installation times, and
        --data-compress=xz, often giving even better compression on
        large datasets at the expense of much longer installation
        times.  (The latter is used for the recommended packages: it is
        particularly effective for 'survival'.)

    o   file() for open = "", "r" or "rt" will automagically detect
        compressed files (from gzip, bzip2 or xz).  This means that
        compressed files can be specified by file name (rather than
        via a gzfile() connection) to read.table(), readlines(),
        scan() and so on.

    o   data() can handle compressed text files with extensions
        .{txt,tab,csv}.{gz,bz2,xz} .


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   png(type="cairo1") is defunct: the value is no longer recognized.

    o   tools::Rd_parse() is defunct (as this version of R uses only
        Rd version 2).

    o   Use of ~/.Rconf (which was deprecated in favour of ~/.Rconfig
        in 2004) has finally been removed.

    o   Bundles of packages are deprecated.  See 'Writing R
        Extensions' for the steps needed to unbundle a bundle.

    o   help() arguments 'offline', 'htmlhelp' and 'chmhelp' are
        deprecated in favour of 'help_type'.

    o   clearNames() ('stats') is deprecated for unname().

    o   Basic regular expressions (extended = FALSE) are deprecated in
        strsplit, grep and friends.  There is a precise POSIX standard
        for them, but it is not what recent RE engines implement, and
        it seems that in almost all cases package authors intended
        fixed = TRUE when using extended = FALSE.

    o   methods::trySilent() is deprecated for  try(*, silent=TRUE) or
        - more efficiently and flexibly - something like
        tryCatch(*, error = function(e) e).

    o   index.search() is deprecated: there are no longer directories of
        types other than 'help'.


INSTALLATION

    o   cairo >= 1.2 is now required (1.2.0 was released in July 2006)
        for cairo-based graphics devices (which remain optional).

    o   A suitable iconv() is now required: support for configure option
        --without-iconv has been withdrawn (it was deprecated in R 2.5.0).

    o   Perl is no longer 'essential'.  R can be built without it, but
        scripts R CMD build, check, Rprof and Sd2d require it.

    o   A system 'glob' function is now essential (a working
        Sys.glob() has been assumed since R 2.9.0 at least).

    o   C99 support for MBCS is now required, and configure option
        --disable-mbcs has been withdrawn.

    o   Having a version of 'tar' capable of automagically detecting
        compressed archives is useful for utils::untar(), and so 'gtar'
        (a common name for GNU tar) is preferred to 'tar': set
        environment variable TAR to specify a particular 'tar' command.


INTERNATIONALIZATION

    o   There is some makefile support for adding/updating translations
        in packages: see po/README and 'Writing R Extensions'.

        There is support for the use of 'dngettext' for C-level
        translations in packages: see 'Writing R Extensions'.


BUG FIXES

    o   Assigning an extra 0-length column to a data frame by
        DF[, "foo"] <- value now works in most cases (by filling with
        NAs) or fails.  (It used to give a corrupt data frame.)

    o   validObject() avoids an error during evaluation in the case
        of various incorrect slot definitions.

    o   n:m now returns a result of type "integer" in a few more
        boundary cases.

    o   The 'zap.ind' argument to printCoefmat() did not usually work as
        other code attempted to ensure that non-zero values had a
        non-zero representation.

    o   printCoefmat() formatted groups of columns together, not just
        the cs.ind group but also the zap.ind group and a residual
        group.  It now formats all columns except the cs.ind group
        separately (and zaps the zap.ind group column-by-column).  The
        main effect will be see in the output from print.anova, as
        this grouped SS-like columns in the zap.ind group.

    o   R_ReplDLLinit() initializes the top-level jump so that some
        embedded applications on Windows no longer crash on error.

    o   identical() failed to take the encoding of character strings
        into account, so identical byte patterns are not necessarily
        identical strings, and similarly Latin-1 and UTF-8 versions of
        the same string differ in byte pattern.

    o   methods(f) used to warn unnecessarily for an S4 generic 'f' which
        had been created based on an existing S3 generic.

    o   The check for consistent ordering of superclasses was not
        ignoring all conditional relations (the symptom was usually
        spurious warnings for classes extending "array").

    o   Trying to assign into a raw vector with an index vector
        containing NAs could cause a segfault.  Reported by Herv? Pag?s.

    o   Rscript could segfault if (by user error) its filename argument
        was missing.  Reported by Martin Morgan.

    o   getAnywhere() (and functions that use it, including argument
        completion in the console) did not handle special built-in
        functions.  Reported by Romain Francois.

    o   order() was missing a PROTECT() call and so could segfault when
        called on character data under certain (rare) circumstances
        involving marked non-native encodings.

    o   prettyNum(z, drop0trailing=TRUE) did not work correctly when z
        was a complex vector.  Consequently, str(z, ...)  also did
        not.  (PR#13985)

    o   'make distclean' removed too many files in etc/ if
        builddir = srcdir.

    o   R CMD replaced TEXINPUTS rather than appending to it (as
        documented and intended).

    o   help.start() no longer fails on unix when "browser" is a
        function.

    o   pbeta(x, *, log.p = TRUE) is sometimes more accurate, e.g., for
        very small x.

    o   Unserializing a pre-2.8 workspace containing pure ASCII character
        objects with a LATIN1 or UTF-8 encoding would corrupt the CHARSXP
        cache.

Message-ID: <4B261164.6070008@biostat.ku.dk>

R-2.10.1.tar.gz was built a short while ago.

This is a maintenance release and fixes a number of mostly minor issues.

See the full list of changes below.

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.10.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.10.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   The PCRE library has been updated to version 8.00.

    o   R CMD INSTALL has new options --no-R, --no-libs, --no-data,
        --no-help, --no-demo, --no-exec, and --no-inst to suppress
        installation of the specified part of the package.  These are
        intended for special purposes (e.g. building a database
        of help pages without fully installing all packages).

    o   The documented line-length limit of 4095 bytes when reading
        from the console now also applies also to parse(file="")
        (which previously had a limit of around 1024 bytes).

    o   A Bioconductor mirror can be set for use by setRepositories()
        via the option "BioC_mirror", e.g. the European mirror can be
        selected by
        options(BioC_mirror="http://bioconductor.statistik.tu-dortmund.de")

    o   Double-clicking in a tk_select.list() list box now selects the
        item and closes the list box (as happens on the Windows
        select.list() widget).

INSTALLATION

    o   configure will be able to find a usable libtiff in some rare
        circumstances where it did not previously (where libtiff
        needed to be linked explicitly against -ljpeg).

    o   Making refman.pdf works around a problem with the indexing
        with hyperref 6.79d and later.

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   The 'extended' argument is deprecated in strsplit(), grep(),
        grepl(), sub(), gsub(), regexpr() and gregexpr() (not just the
        value extended = FALSE) and will be removed in R 2.11.0.

BUG FIXES

    o   trigamma(x) and other psigamma(x, n) calls are now accurate for
        very large abs(x). (PR#14020)

    o   [g]sub(perl=FALSE, fixed=FALSE) could use excessive stack space
        when used with a very long vector containing some non-ASCII
        strings.

    o   The default method of weighted.mean(na.rm = TRUE) did not omit
        weights for NA observations in 2.10.0.  (PR#14032)

    o   [g]regexpr(pattern, fixed = TRUE) returned match positions in
        bytes (not characters) in an MBCS locale if 'pattern' was a
        single byte.

        [g]sub(fixed = TRUE) with a single-byte pattern could
        conceivably have matched part of a multibyte character in a
        non-UTF-8 MBCS.

    o   findLineNum() and setBreakpoint() would sometimes fail if the
        specified file was not in the current directory.

    o   Package tcltk's demo(tkdensity) was broken in 2.9.0 when demo()
        was changed to set par(ask = TRUE).

    o   gsub() with backrefs could fail on extremely long strings
        (hundreds of thousands of characters) due to integer overflow
        in a length calculation.

    o   abline(*, untf=TRUE) now uses a better x-grid in log-scale, e.g.,
        for plot(c(1,300), c(1,300), log="xy") ; abline(4,1, untf=TRUE).

    o   detach/unloadNamespace() arrange to flush the package's
        lazyload cache of R objects once the package/namespace is no
        longer needed.

    o   There have been small fixes to the rendering of help,
        e.g. \command is now rendered verbatim (so e.g. -- is not
        interpreted, PR#14045).

        Also, there are many small changes to help files where the new
        converters were not rendering them in the same way as before.

    o   available.packages() would fail when run on a repository
        with no packages meeting the filtering conditions. (PR#14042)

    o   rep(x, times, each = 2) gave invalid results when the 'times'
        argument is a vector longer than 'x'.  Reported by Bill Dunlap.

    o   An error when unloadNamespace() attempted to run the .onUnload()
        function gave an error in the reporting function and so was
        not reported properly.

    o   Text help rendering did not handle very long input lines
        properly.

    o   promptMethods() generated signature documentation improperly.

    o   pgamma(x, a, lower.tail=FALSE) and qgamma(..) are now
        considerably more accurate in some regions for very small 'a'.
        qgamma() now correctly returns 0 instead of NaN in similar
        extreme cases, and qgamma() no longer warns in the case of
        small 'a', see (PR#12324).

    o   unname() now also removes names from a zero length vector.

    o   Printing results from ls.str() no longer evaluates unevaluated
        calls.

    o   complete.cases() failed on a 0-column data frame argument.
        (Underlies PR#14066.)

        It could return nonsensical results if no input determined the
        number of cases (seen in the no-segfault tests).

    o   An error in nls() with a long formula could cause a segfault.
        (PR#14059)

    o   qchisq(p, df, ncp, lower.tail = FALSE) with ncp >= 80 was
        inaccurate for small p (as the help page said): it is now
        less inaccurate. (In part, PR#13999.)

        For ncp less than but close to 80, pchisq() and qchisq() are
        more accurate for probablilities very close to 1 (a series
        expansion was truncated slightly too early).

        pchisq(x, df, ncp) can no longer return values just larger
        than one for large values of ncp.

    o   intToUtf8() could fail when asked to produce 10Mb or more
        strings, something it was never intended to do: unfortunately
        Windows crashed R (other OSes reported a lack of resources).
        (PR#14068)

    o   chisq.test() could fail when given argument 'x' or 'y' which
        deparsed to more than one line.  (Reported by Laurent Gauthier.)

    o   S4 methods are uncached whenever the name space containing
        them is unloaded (by unloadNamespace() as well as by
        detach(unload = TRUE)).

    o   The internal record-keeping by dyn.load/dyn.unload was
        incomplete, which could crash R if a DLL that registered
        .External routines had earlier been unloaded.

    o   bessel[JY](x, nu) with nu a negative integer (a singular case)
        is now correct, analogously to besselI(), see PR#13556, below.

    o   tools::file_path_as_absolute() doubled the file separator when
        applied to a file such as "/vmunix" or (on Windows) "d:/afile"
        in a directory for which getwd() would return a path with a
        trailing separator (largely cosmetic, as reasonable file
        systems handle such a path correctly).  (Perhaps what was
        meant by PR#14078.)

    o   unsplit(drop = TRUE) applied to a data frame failed to pass
        'drop' to the computation of row names. (PR#14084)

    o   The "difftime" method of mean() ignored its 'na.rm' argument.

    o   tcltk::tk_select.list() is now more likely to remove the
        widget immediately after selection is complete.

    o   Adding/subtracting a "difftime" object to/from a "POSIXt" or
        "Date" object works again (it was broken by the addition of
        Ops.difftime).

    o   Conversion to latex of an Rd file with no aliases failed.

    o   wilcox.test(*, conf.int=TRUE) has achieved.level corrected and, for
        exact=FALSE, now gives an 'estimate' which does not depend on the
        alternative used.

    o   help.search() failed when the package argument was specified.
        (PR#14113)

    o   switch(EXPR = "A")  now returns NULL, as switch(1) {which used to
        signal an error}.
