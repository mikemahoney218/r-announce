Subject: [R] R 2.12.2 is released
Message-ID: <21DD70BD-EA56-46B5-A29C-1092EB091A5E@cbs.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.12.2.tar.gz a short while ago. This is an update release, which fixes a number of mostly minor issues, and one major issue in which complex arithmetic was being messed up on some compiler platform.

You can get it from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.12.2.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.2:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    ? Complex arithmetic (notably z^n for complex z and integer n) gave
      incorrect results since R 2.10.0 on platforms without C99 complex
      support.  This and some lesser issues in trignometric functions
      have been corrected.

      Such platforms were rare (we know of Cygwin and FreeBSD).
      However, because of new compiler optimizations in the way complex
      arguments are handled, the same code was selected on x86_64 Linux
      with gcc 4.5.x at the default -O2 optimization (but not at -O).

    ? There is a workaround for crashes seen with several packages on
      systems using zlib 1.2.5: see the INSTALLATION section.

  NEW FEATURES:

    ? PCRE has been updated to 8.12 (two bug-fix releases since 8.10).

    ? rep(), seq(), seq.int() and seq_len() report more often when the
      first element is taken of an argument of incorrect length.

    ? The Cocoa back-end for the quartz() graphics device on Mac OS X
      provides a way to disable event loop processing temporarily
      (useful, e.g., for forked instances of R).

    ? kernel()'s default for m was not appropriate if coef was a set of
      coefficients.  (Reported by Pierre Chausse.)

    ? bug.report() has been updated for the current R bug tracker,
      which does not accept emailed submissions.

    ? R CMD check now checks for the correct use of $(LAPACK_LIBS) (as
      well as $(BLAS_LIBS)), since several CRAN recent submissions have
      ignored ?Writing R Extensions?.

  INSTALLATION:

    ? The zlib sources in the distribution are now built with all
      symbols remapped: this is intended to avoid problems seen with
      packages such as XML and rggobi which link to zlib.so.1 on
      systems using zlib 1.2.5.

    ? The default for FFLAGS and FCFLAGS with gfortran on x86_64 Linux
      has been changed back to -g -O2: however, setting -g -O may still
      be needed for gfortran 4.3.x.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    ? A LazyDataCompression field in the DESCRIPTION file will be used
      to set the value for the --data-compress option of R CMD INSTALL.

    ? Files R/sysdata.rda of more than 1Mb are now stored in the
      lazyload daabase using xz compression: this for example halves
      the installed size of package Imap.

    ? R CMD INSTALL now ensures that directories installed from inst
      have search permission for everyone.

      It no longer installs files inst/doc/Rplots.ps and
      inst/doc/Rplots.pdf.  These are almost certainly left-overs from
      Sweave runs, and are often large.

  DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT:

    ? The ?experimental? alternative specification of a name space via
      .Export() etc is now deprecated.

    ? zip.file.extract() is now deprecated.

    ? Zip-ing data sets in packages (and hence R CMD INSTALL
      --use-zip-data and the ZipData: yes field in a DESCRIPTION file)
      is deprecated: using efficiently compressed .rda images and
      lazy-loading of data has superseded it.

  BUG FIXES:

    ? identical() could in rare cases generate a warning about
      non-pairlist attributes on CHARSXPs.  As these are used for
      internal purposes, the attribute check should be skipped.
      (Reported by Niels Richard Hansen).

    ? If the filename extension (usually .Rnw) was not included in a
      call to Sweave(), source references would not work properly and
      the keep.source option failed.  (PR#14459)

    ? format.data.frame() now keeps zero character column names.

    ? pretty(x) no longer raises an error when x contains solely
      non-finite values. (PR#14468)

    ? The plot.TukeyHSD() function now uses a line width of 0.5 for its
      reference lines rather than lwd = 0 (which caused problems for
      some PDF and PostScript viewers).

    ? The big.mark argument to prettyNum(), format(), etc. was inserted
      reversed if it was more than one character long.

    ? R CMD check failed to check the filenames under man for Windows'
      reserved names.

    ? The "Date" and "POSIXt" methods for seq() could overshoot when to
      was supplied and by was specified in months or years.

    ? The internal method of untar() now restores hard links as file
      copies rather than symbolic links (which did not work for
      cross-directory links).

    ? unzip() did not handle zip files which contained filepaths with
      two or more leading directories which were not in the zipfile and
      did not already exist.  (It is unclear if such zipfiles are valid
      and the third-party C code used did not support them, but
      PR#14462 created one.)

    ? combn(n, m) now behaves more regularly for the border case m = 0.
      (PR#14473)

    ? The rendering of numbers in plotmath expressions (e.g.
      expression(10^2)) used the current settings for conversion to
      strings rather than setting the defaults, and so could be
      affected by what has been done before.  (PR#14477)

    ? The methods of napredict() and naresid() for na.action =
      na.exclude fits did not work correctly in the very rare event
      that every case had been omitted in the fit.  (Reported by Simon
      Wood.)

    ? weighted.residuals(drop0=TRUE) returned a vector when the
      residuals were a matrix (e.g. those of class "mlm").  (Reported
      by Bill Dunlap.)

    ? Package HTML index files <pkg>/html/00Index.html were generated
      with a stylesheet reference that was not correct for static
      browsing in libraries.

    ? ccf(na.action = na.pass) was not implemented.

    ? The parser accepted some incorrect numeric constants, e.g. 20x2.
      (Reported by Olaf Mersmann.)

    ? format(*, zero.print) did not always replace the full zero parts.

    ? Fixes for subsetting or subassignment of "raster" objects when
      not both i and j are specified.

    ? R CMD INSTALL was not always respecting the ZipData: yes field of
      a DESCRIPTION file (although this is frequently incorrectly
      specified for packages with no data or which specify lazy-loading
      of data).

      R CMD INSTALL --use-zip-data was incorrectly implemented as
      --use-zipdata since R 2.9.0.

    ? source(file, echo=TRUE) could fail if the file contained #line
      directives.  It now recovers more gracefully, but may still
      display the wrong line if the directive gives incorrect
      information.

    ? atan(1i) returned NaN+Infi (rather than 0+Infi) on platforms
      without C99 complex support.

    ? library() failed to cache S4 metadata (unlike loadNamespace())
      causing failures in S4-using packages without a namespace (e.g.
      those using reference classes).

    ? The function qlogis(lp, log.p=TRUE) no longer prematurely
      overflows to Inf when exp(lp) is close to 1.

    ? Updating S4 methods for a group generic function requires
      resetting the methods tables for the members of the group (patch
      contributed by Martin Morgan).

    ? In some circumstances (including for package XML), R CMD INSTALL
      installed version-control directories from source packages.

    ? Added PROTECT calls to some constructed expressions used in C
      level eval calls.

    ? utils:::create.post() (used by bug.report() and help.request())
      failed to quote arguments to the mailer, and so often failed.

    ? bug.report() was naive about how to extract maintainer email
      addresses from package descriptions, so would often try mailing
      to incorrect addresses.

    ? debugger() could fail to read the environment of a call to a
      function with a ... argument.  (Reported by Charlie Roosen.)

    ? prettyNum(c(1i, NA), drop0=TRUE) or str(NA_complex_) now work
      correctly.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.13.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    ? replicate() (by default) and vapply() (always) now return a
      higher-dimensional array instead of a matrix in the case where
      the inner function value is an array of dimension >= 2.

    ? Printing and formatting of floating point numbers is now using
      the correct number of digits, where it previously rarely differed
      by a few digits. (See ?scientific? entry below.)  This affects
      _many_ *.Rout.save checks in packages.

  NEW FEATURES:

    ? normalizePath() has been moved to the base package (from utils):
      this is so it can be used by library() and friends.

      It now does tilde expansion.

      It gains new arguments winslash (to select the separator on
      Windows) and mustWork to control the action if a canonical path
      cannot be found.

    ? The previously barely documented limit of 256 bytes on a symbol
      name has been raised to 10,000 bytes (a sanity check).  Long
      symbol names can sometimes occur when deparsing expressions (for
      example, in model.frame).

    ? reformulate() gains a intercept argument.

    ? cmdscale(add = FALSE) now uses the more common definition that
      there is a representation in n-1 or less dimensions, and only
      dimensions corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used.
      (Avoids confusion such as PR#14397.)

    ? Names used by c(), unlist(), cbind() and rbind() are marked with
      an encoding when this can be ascertained.

    ? R colours are now defined to refer to the sRGB color space.

      The PDF, PostScript, and Quartz graphics devices record this
      fact.  X11 (and Cairo) and Windows just assume that your screen
      conforms.

    ? system.file() gains a mustWork argument (suggestion of Bill
      Dunlap).

    ? new.env(hash = TRUE) is now the default.

    ? list2env(envir = NULL) defaults to hashing (with a suitably sized
      environment) for lists of more than 100 elements.

    ? text() gains a formula method.

    ? IQR() now has a type argument which is passed to quantile().

    ? as.vector(), as.double() etc duplicate less when they leave the
      mode unchanged but remove attributes.

      as.vector(mode = "any") no longer duplicates when it does not
      remove attributes.  This helps memory usage in matrix() and
      array().

      matrix() duplicates less if data is an atomic vector with
      attributes such as names (but no class).

      dim(x) <- NULL duplicates less if x has neither dimensions nor
      names (since this operation removes names and dimnames).

    ? setRepositories() gains an addURLs argument.

    ? chisq.test() now also returns a stdres component, for
      standardized residuals (which have unit variance, unlike the
      Pearson residuals).

    ? write.table() and friends gain a fileEncoding argument, to
      simplify writing files for use on other OSes (e.g. a spreadsheet
      intended for Windows or Mac OS X Excel).

    ? Assignment expressions of the form foo::bar(x) <- y and
      foo:::bar(x) <- y now work; the replacement functions used are
      foo::`bar<-` and foo:::`bar<-`.

    ? Sys.getenv() gains a names argument so Sys.getenv(x, names =
      FALSE) can replace the common idiom of as.vector(Sys.getenv()).
      The default has been changed to not name a length-one result.

    ? Lazy loading of environments now preserves attributes and locked
      status. (The locked status of bindings and active bindings are
      still not preserved; this may be addressed in the future).

    ? options("install.lock") may be set to FALSE so that
      install.packages() defaults to --no-lock installs, or (on
      Windows) to TRUE so that binary installs implement locking.

    ? sort(partial = p) for large p now tries Shellsort if quicksort is
      not appropriate and so works for non-numeric atomic vectors.

    ? sapply() gets a new option simplify = "array" which returns a
      ?higher rank? array instead of just a matrix when FUN() returns a
      dim() length of two or more.

      replicate() has this option set by default, and vapply() now
      behaves that way internally.

    ? aperm() becomes S3 generic and gets a table method which
      preserves the class.

    ? merge() and as.hclust() methods for objects of class "dendrogram"
      are now provided.

    ? as.POSIXlt.factor() now passes ... to the character method
      (suggestion of Joshua Ulrich).

    ? The character method of as.POSIXlt() now tries to find a format
      that works for all non-NA inputs, not just the first one.

    ? str() now has a method for class "Date" analogous to that for
      class "POSIXt".

    ? New function file.link() to create hard links on those file
      systems (POSIX, NTFS but not FAT) that support them.

    ? New Summary() group method for class "ordered" implements min(),
      max() and range() for ordered factors.

    ? mostattributes<-() now consults the "dim" attribute and not the
      dim() function, making it more useful for objects (such as data
      frames) from classes with methods for dim().  It also uses
      attr<-() in preference to the generics name<-(), dim<-() and
      dimnames<-().  (Related to PR#14469.)

    ? There is a new option "browserNLdisabled" to disable the use of
      an empty (e.g. via the ?Return? key) as a synonym for c in
      browser() or n under debug().  (Wish of PR#14472.)

    ? example() gains optional new arguments character.only and
      give.lines enabling programmatic exploration.

    ? serialize() and unserialize() are no longer described as
      ?experimental?.  The interface is now regarded as stable,
      although the serialization format may well change in future
      releases.  (serialize() has a new argument version which would
      allow the current format to be written if that happens.)

      New functions saveRDS() and readRDS() are public versions of the
      ?internal? functions .saveRDS() and .readRDS() made available for
      general use.  The dot-name versions remain available as several
      package authors have made use of them, despite the documentation.

      saveRDS() supports compress = "xz".

    ? Many functions when called with a not-open connection will now
      ensure that the connection is left not-open in the event of
      error.  These include read.dcf(), dput(), dump(), load(),
      parse(), readBin(), readChar(), readLines(), save(), writeBin(),
      writeChar(), writeLines(), .readRDS(), .saveRDS() and
      tools::parse_Rd(), as well as functions calling these.

    ? Public functions find.package() and path.package() replace the
      internal dot-name versions.

    ? The default method for terms() now looks for a "terms" attribute
      if it does not find a "terms" component, and so works for model
      frames.

    ? httpd() handlers receive an additional argument containing the
      full request headers as a raw vector (this can be used to parse
      cookies, multi-part forms etc.). The recommended full signature
      for handlers is therefore function(url, query, body, headers,
      ...).

    ? file.edit() gains a fileEncoding argument to specify the encoding
      of the file(s).

    ? The format of the HTML package listings has changed.  If there is
      more than one library tree , a table of links to libraries is
      provided at the top and bottom of the page.  Where a library
      contains more than 100 packages, an alphabetic index is given at
      the top of the section for that library.  (As a consequence,
      package names are now sorted case-insensitively whatever the
      locale.)

    ? isSeekable() now returns FALSE on connections which have
      non-default encoding.  Although documented to record if ?in
      principle? the connection supports seeking, it seems safer to
      report FALSE when it may not work.

    ? R CMD REMOVE and remove.packages() now remove file R.css when
      removing all remaining packages in a library tree.  (Related to
      the wish of PR#14475: note that this file is no longer
      installed.)

    ? unzip() now has a unzip argument like zip.file.extract().  This
      allows an external unzip program to be used, which can be useful
      to access features supported by Info-ZIP's unzip version 6 which
      is now becoming more widely available.

    ? There is a simple zip() function, as wrapper for an external zip
      command.

    ? bzfile() connections can now read from concatenated bzip2 files
      (including files written with bzfile(open = "a")) and files
      created by some other compressors (such as the example of
      PR#14479).

    ? The primitive function c() is now of type BUILTIN.

    ? plot(<dendrogram>, .., nodePar=*) now obeys an optional xpd
      specification (allowing clipping to be turned off completely).

    ? nls(algorithm="port") now shares more code with nlminb(), and is
      more consistent with the other nls() algorithms in its return
      value.

    ? xz has been updated to 5.0.1 (very minor bugfix release).

    ? image() has gained a logical useRaster argument allowing it to
      use a bitmap raster for plotting a regular grid instead of
      polygons. This can be more efficient, but may not be supported by
      all devices. The default is FALSE.

    ? list.files()/dir() gains a new argument include.dirs() to include
      directories in the listing when recursive = TRUE.

    ? New function list.dirs() lists all directories, (even empty
      ones).

    ? file.copy() now (by default) copies read/write/execute
      permissions on files, moderated by the current setting of
      Sys.umask().

    ? Sys.umask() now accepts mode = NA and returns the current umask
      value (visibly) without changing it.

    ? There is a ! method for classes "octmode" and "hexmode": this
      allows xor(a, b) to work if both a and b are from one of those
      classes.

    ? as.raster() no longer fails for vectors or matrices containing
      NAs.

    ? New hook "before.new.plot" allows functions to be run just before
      advancing the frame in plot.new, which is potentially useful for
      custom figure layout implementations.

    ? Package tools has a new function compactPDF() to try to reduce
      the size of PDF files _via_ qpdf or gs.

    ? tar() has a new argument extra_flags.

    ? dotchart() accepts more general objects x such as 1D tables which
      can be coerced by as.numeric() to a numeric vector, with a
      warning since that might not be appropriate.

    ? The previously internal function create.post() is now exported
      from utils, and the documentation for bug.report() and
      help.request() now refer to that for create.post().

      It has a new method = "mailto" on Unix-alikes similar to that on
      Windows: it invokes a default mailer via open (Mac OS X) or
      xdg-open or the default browser (elsewhere).

      The default for ccaddress is now getOption("ccaddress") which is
      by default unset: using the username as a mailing address
      nowadays rarely works as expected.

    ? The default for options("mailer") is now "mailto" on all
      platforms.

    ? unlink() now does tilde-expansion (like most other file
      functions).

    ? file.rename() now allows vector arguments (of the same length).

    ? The "glm" method for logLik() now returns an "nobs" attribute
      (which stats4::BIC() assumed it did).

      The "nls" method for logLik() gave incorrect results for zero
      weights.

    ? There is a new generic function nobs() in package stats, to
      extract from model objects a suitable value for use in BIC
      calculations.  An S4 generic derived from it is defined in
      package stats4.

    ? Code for S4 reference-class methods is now examined for possible
      errors in non-local assignments.

    ? findClasses, getGeneric, findMethods and hasMethods are revised
      to deal consistently with the package= argument and be consistent
      with soft namespace policy for finding objects.

    ? tools::Rdiff() now has the option to return not only the status
      but a character vector of observed differences (which are still
      by default sent to stdout).

    ? The startup environment variables R_ENVIRON_USER, R_ENVIRON,
      R_PROFILE_USER and R_PROFILE are now treated more consistently.
      In all cases an empty value is considered to be set and will stop
      the default being used, and for the last two tilde expansion is
      performed on the file name.  (Note that setting an empty value is
      probably impossible on Windows.)

    ? Using R --no-environ CMD, R --no-site-file CMD or R
      --no-init-file CMD sets environment variables so these settings
      are passed on to child R processes, notably those run by INSTALL,
      check and build. R --vanilla CMD sets these three options (but
      not --no-restore).

    ? smooth.spline() is somewhat faster.  With cv=NA it allows some
      leverage computations to be skipped,

    ? The internal (C) function scientific(), at the heart of R's
      format.info(x), format(x), print(x), etc, for numeric x, has been
      re-written in order to provide slightly more correct results,
      fixing PR#14491, notably in border cases including when digits >=
      16, thanks to substantial contributions (code and experiments)
      from Petr Savicky.  This affects a noticable amount of numeric
      output from R.

    ? A new function grepRaw() has been introduced for finding subsets
      of raw vectors. It supports both literal searches and regular
      expressions.

    ? Package compiler is now provided as a standard package.  See
      ?compiler::compile for information on how to use the compiler.
      This package implements a byte code compiler for R: by default
      the compiler is not used in this release.  See the ?R
      Installation and Administration Manual? for how to compile the
      base and recommended packages.

    ? Providing an exportPattern directive in a NAMESPACE file now
      causes classes to be exported according to the same pattern, for
      example the default from package.skeleton() to specify all names
      starting with a letter.  An explicit directive to
      exportClassPattern will still over-ride.

    ? There is an additional marked encoding "bytes" for character
      strings.  This is intended to be used for non-ASCII strings which
      should be treated as a set of bytes, and never re-encoded as if
      they were in the encoding of the currrent locale: useBytes = TRUE
      is autmatically selected in functions such as writeBin(),
      writeLines(), grep() and strsplit().

      Only a few character operations are supported (such as substr()).

      Printing, format() and cat() will represent non-ASCII bytes in
      such strings by a \xab escape.

    ? The new function removeSource() removes the internally stored
      source from a function.

    ? "srcref" attributes now include two additional line number
      values, recording the line numbers in the order they were parsed.

    ? New functions have been added for source reference access:
      getSrcFilename(), getSrcDirectory(), getSrcLocation() and
      getSrcref().

    ? Sys.chmod() has an extra argument use_umask which defaults to
      true and restricts the file mode by the current setting of umask.
      This means that all the R functions which manipulate
      file/directory permissions by default respect umask, notably R
      CMD INSTALL.

    ? tempfile() has an extra argument fileext to create a temporary
      filename with a specified extension.  (Suggestion and initial
      implementation by Dirk Eddelbuettel.)

      There are improvements in the way Sweave() and Stangle() handle
      non-ASCII vignette sources, especially in a UTF-8 locale: see
      ?Writing R Extensions? which now has a subsection on this topic.

    ? factanal() now returns the rotation matrix if a rotation such as
      "promax" is used, and hence factor correlations are displayed.
      (Wish of PR#12754.)

    ? The gctorture2() function provides a more refined interface to
      the GC torture process.  Environment variables R_GCTORTURE,
      R_GCTORTURE_WAIT, and R_GCTORTURE_INHIBIT_RELEASE can also be
      used to control the GC torture process.

    ? file.copy(from, to) no longer regards it as an error to supply a
      zero-length from: it now simply does nothing.

    ? rstandard.glm gains a type argument which can be used to request
      standardized Pearson residuals.

    ? A start on a Turkish translation, thanks to Murat Alkan.

    ? .libPaths() calls normalizePath(winslash = "/") on the paths:
      this helps (usually) present them in a user-friendly form and
      should detect duplicate paths accessed via different symbolic
      links.

  SWEAVE CHANGES:

    ? Sweave() has options to produce PNG and JPEG figures, and to use
      a custom function to open a graphics device (see ?RweaveLatex).
      (Based in part on the contribution of PR#14418.)

    ? The default for Sweave() is to produce only PDF figures (rather
      than both EPS and PDF).

    ? Environment variable SWEAVE_OPTIONS can be used to supply
      defaults for existing or new options to be applied after the
      Sweave driver setup has been run.

    ? The Sweave manual is now included as a vignette in the utils
      package.

    ? Sweave() handles keep.source=TRUE much better: it could duplicate
      some lines and omit comments. (Reported by John Maindonald and
      others.)

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    ? Because they use a C99 interface which a C++ compiler is not
      required to support, Rvprintf and REvprintf are only defined by
      R_ext/Print.h in C++ code if the macro R_USE_C99_IN_CXX is
      defined when it is included.

    ? pythag duplicated the C99 function hypot.  It is no longer
      provided, but is used as a substitute for hypot in the very
      unlikely event that the latter is not available.

    ? R_inspect(obj) and R_inspect3(obj, deep, pvec) are (hidden)
      C-level entry points to the internal inspect function and can be
      used for C-level debugging (e.g., in conjunction with the p
      command in gdb).

    ? Compiling R with --enable-strict-barrier now also enables
      additional checking for use of unprotected objects. In
      combination with gctorture() or gctorture2() and a C-level
      debugger this can be useful for tracking down memory protection
      issues.

  UTILITIES:

    ? R CMD Rdiff is now implemented in R on Unix-alikes (as it has
      been on Windows since R 2.12.0).

    ? R CMD build no longer does any cleaning in the supplied package
      directory: all the cleaning is done in the copy.

      It has a new option --install-args to pass arguments to R CMD
      INSTALL for --build (but not when installing to rebuild
      vignettes).

      There is new option, --resave-data, to call
      tools::resaveRdaFiles() on the data directory, to compress
      tabular files (.tab, .csv etc) and to convert .R files to .rda
      files.  The default, --resave-data=gzip, is to do so in a way
      compatible even with years-old versions of R, but better
      compression is given by --resave-data=best, requiring R >=
      2.10.0.

      It now adds a datalist file for data directories of more than
      1Mb.

      Patterns in .Rbuildignore are now also matched against all
      directory names (including those of empty directories).

      There is a new option, --compact-vignettes, to try reducing the
      size of PDF files in the inst/doc directory.  Currently this
      tries qpdf: other options may be used in future.

      When re-building vignettes and a inst/doc/Makefile file is found,
      make clean is run if the makefile has a clean: target.

      After re-building vignettes the default clean-up operation will
      remove any directories (and not just files) created during the
      process: e.g. one package created a .R_cache directory.

      Empty directories are now removed unless the option
      --keep-empty-dirs is given (and a few packages do deliberately
      include empty directories).

      If there is a field BuildVignettes in the package DESCRIPTION
      file with a false value, re-building the vignettes is skipped.

    ? R CMD check now also checks for filenames that are
      case-insensitive matches to Windows' reserved file names with
      extensions, such as nul.Rd, as these have caused problems on some
      Windows systems.

      It checks for inefficiently saved data/*.rda and data/*.RData
      files, and reports on those large than 100Kb.  A more complete
      check (including of the type of compression, but potentially much
      slower) can be switched on by setting environment variable
      _R_CHECK_COMPACT_DATA2_ to TRUE.

      The types of files in the data directory are now checked, as
      packages are _still_ misusing it for non-R data files.

      It now extracts and runs the R code for each vignette in a
      separate directory and R process: this is done in the package's
      declared encoding.  Rather than call tools::checkVignettes(), it
      calls tool::buildVignettes() to see if the vignettes can be
      re-built as they would be by R CMD build.  Option --use-valgrind
      now applies only to these runs, and not when running code to
      rebuild the vignettes.  This version does a much better job of
      suppressing output from successful vignette tests.

      The 00check.log file is a more complete record of what is output
      to stdout: in particular contains more details of the tests.

      It now check all syntactically valid Rd usage entries, and warns
      about assignments (unless these give the usage of replacement
      functions).

      .tar.xz compressed tarballs are now allowed, if tar supports them
      (and setting environment variable TAR to internal ensures so on
      all platforms).

    ? R CMD check now warns if it finds inst/doc/makefile, and R CMD
      build renames such a file to inst/doc/Makefile.

  INSTALLATION:

    ? Installing R no longer tries to find perl, and R CMD no longer
      tries to substitute a full path for awk nor perl - this was a
      legacy from the days when they were used by R itself.  Because a
      couple of packages do use awk, it is set as the make (rather than
      environment) variable AWK.

    ? make check will now fail if there are differences from the
      reference output when testing package examples and if environment
      variable R_STRICT_PACKAGE_CHECK is set to a true value.

    ? The C99 double complex type is now required.

      The C99 complex trigonometric functions (such as csin) are not
      currently required (FreeBSD lacks most of them): substitutes are
      used if they are missing.

    ? The C99 system call va_copy is now required.

    ? If environment variable R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set during
      configuration (for example in config.site) it is used unchanged
      in file etc/ldpaths rather than being appended to.

    ? configure looks for support for OpenMP and if found compiles R
      with appropriate flags and also makes them available for use in
      packages: see ?Writing R Extensions?.

      This is currently experimental, and is only used in R with a
      single thread for colSums() and colMeans().  Expect it to be more
      widely used in later versions of R.

      This can be disabled by the --disable-openmp flag.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    ? R CMD INSTALL --clean now removes copies of a src directory which
      are created when multiple sub-architectures are in use.
      (Following a comment from Berwin Turlach.)

    ? File R.css is now installed on a per-package basis (in the
      package's html directory) rather than in each library tree, and
      this is used for all the HTML pages in the package.  This helps
      when installing packages with static HTML pages for use on a
      webserver.  It will also allow future versions of R to use
      different stylesheets for the packages they install.

    ? A top-level file .Rinstignore in the package sources can list (in
      the same way as .Rbuildignore) files under inst that should not
      be installed.  (Why should there be any such files?  Because all
      the files needed to re-build vignettes need to be under inst/doc,
      but they may not need to be installed.)

    ? R CMD INSTALL has a new option --compact-docs to compact any PDFs
      under the inst/doc directory.  Currently this uses qpdf, which
      must be installed (see ?Writing R Extensions?).

    ? There is a new option --lock which can be used to cancel the
      effect of --no-lock or --pkglock earlier on the command line.

    ? Option --pkglock can now be used with more than one package, and
      is now the default if only one package is specified.

    ? Argument lock of install.packages() can now be use for Mac binary
      installs as well as for Windows ones.  The value "pkglock" is now
      accepted, as well as TRUE and FALSE (the default).

    ? There is a new option --no-clean-on-error for R CMD INSTALL to
      retain a partially installed package for forensic analysis.

    ? Packages with names ending in . are not portable since Windows
      does not work correctly with such directory names.  This is now
      warned about in R CMD check, and will not be allowed in R 2.14.x.

    ? The vignette indices are more comprehensive (in the style of
      browseVignetttes()).

  DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT:

    ? require(save = TRUE) is defunct, and use of the save argument is
      deprecated.

    ? R CMD check --no-latex is defunct: use --no-manual instead.

    ? R CMD Sd2Rd is defunct.

    ? The gamma argument to hsv(), rainbow(), and rgb2hsv() is
      deprecated and no longer has any effect.

    ? The previous options for R CMD build --binary (--auto-zip,
      --use-zip-data and --no-docs) are deprecated (or defunct): use
      the new option --install-args instead.

    ? When a character value is used for the EXPR argument in switch(),
      only a single unnamed alternative value is now allowed.

    ? The wrapper utils::link.html.help() is no longer available.

    ? Zip-ing data sets in packages (and hence R CMD INSTALL options
      --use-zip-data and --auto-zip, as well as the ZipData: yes field
      in a DESCRIPTION file) is defunct.

      Installed packages with zip-ed data sets can still be used, but a
      warning that they should be re-installed will be given.

    ? The ?experimental? alternative specification of a name space via
      .Export() etc is now defunct.

    ? The option --unsafe to R CMD INSTALL is deprecated: use the
      identical option --no-lock instead.

    ? The entry point pythag in Rmath.h is deprecated in favour of the
      C99 function hypot.  A wrapper for hypot is provided for R 2.13.x
      only.

    ? Direct access to the "source" attribute of functions is
      deprecated; use deparse(fn, control="useSource") to access it,
      and removeSource(fn) to remove it.

    ? R CMD build --binary is now formally deprecated: R CMD INSTALL
      --build has long been the preferred alternative.

    ? Single-character package names are deprecated (and R is already
      disallowed to avoid confusion in Depends: fields).

  BUG FIXES:

    ? drop.terms and the [ method for class "terms" no longer add back
      an intercept.  (Reported by Niels Hansen.)

    ? aggregate preserves the class of a column (e.g. a date) under
      some circumstances where it discarded the class previously.

    ? p.adjust() now always returns a vector result, as documented.  In
      previous versions it copied attributes (such as dimensions) from
      the p argument: now it only copies names.

    ? On PDF and PostScript devices, a line width of zero was recorded
      verbatim and this caused problems for some viewers (a very thin
      line combined with a non-solid line dash pattern could also cause
      a problem).  On these devices, the line width is now limited at
      0.01 and for very thin lines with complex dash patterns the
      device may force the line dash pattern to be solid.  (Reported by
      Jari Oksanen.)

    ? The str() method for class "POSIXt" now gives sensible output for
      0-length input.

    ? The one- and two-argument complex maths functions failed to warn
      if NAs were generated (as their numeric analogues do).

    ? Added .requireCachedGenerics to the dont.mind list for library()
      to avoid warnings about duplicates.

    ? $<-.data.frame messed with the class attribute, breaking any S4
      subclass.  The S4 data.frame class now has its own $<- method,
      and turns dispatch on for this primitive.

    ? Map() did not look up a character argument f in the correct
      frame, thanks to lazy evaluation.  (PR#14495)

    ? file.copy() did not tilde-expand from and to when to was a
      directory.  (PR#14507)

    ? It was possible (but very rare) for the loading test in R CMD
      INSTALL to crash a child R process and so leave around a lock
      directory and a partially installed package.  That test is now
      done in a separate process.

    ? plot(<formula>, data=<matrix>,..) now works in more cases;
      similarly for points(), lines() and text().

    ? edit.default() contained a manual dispatch for matrices (the
      "matrix" class didn't really exist when it was written).  This
      caused an infinite recursion in the no-GUI case and has now been
      removed.

    ? data.frame(check.rows = TRUE) sometimes worked when it should
      have detected an error.  (PR#14530)

    ? scan(sep= , strip.white=TRUE) sometimes stripped trailing spaces
      from within quoted strings.  (The real bug in PR#14522.)

    ? The rank-correlation methods for cor() and cov() with use =
      "complete.obs" computed the ranks before removing missing values,
      whereas the documentation implied incomplete cases were removed
      first.  (PR#14488)

      They also failed for 1-row matrices.

    ? The perpendicular adjustment used in placing text and expressions
      in the margins of plots was not scaled by par("mex"). (Part of
      PR#14532.)

    ? Quartz Cocoa device now catches any Cocoa exceptions that occur
      during the creation of the device window to prevent crashes.  It
      also imposes a limit of 144 ft^2 on the area used by a window to
      catch user errors (unit misinterpretation) early.

    ? The browser (invoked by debug(), browser() or otherwise) would
      display attributes such as "wholeSrcref" that were intended for
      internal use only.

    ? R's internal filename completion now properly handles filenames
      with spaces in them even when the readline library is used.  This
      resolves PR#14452 provided the internal filename completion is
      used (e.g., by setting rc.settings(files = TRUE)).

    ? Inside uniroot(f, ...), -Inf function values are now replaced by
      a maximally *negative* value.

    ? rowsum() could silently over/underflow on integer inputs
      (reported by Bill Dunlap).

    ? as.matrix() did not handle "dist" objects with zero rows.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.2 patched:

  NEW FEATURES:

    ? max() and min() work harder to ensure that NA has precedence over
      NaN, so e.g. min(NaN, NA) is NA.  (This was not previously
      documented except for within a single numeric vector, where
      compiler optimizations often defeated the code.)

  BUG FIXES:

    ? A change to the C function R_tryEval had broken error messages in
      S4 method selection; the error message is now printed.

    ? PDF output with a non-RGB color model used RGB for the line
      stroke color.  (PR#14511)

    ? stats4::BIC() assumed without checking that an object of class
      "logLik" has an "nobs" attribute: glm() fits did not and so BIC()
      failed for them.

    ? In some circumstances a one-sided mantelhaen.test() reported the
      p-value for the wrong tail.  (PR#14514)

    ? Passing the invalid value lty = NULL to axis() sent an invalid
      value to the graphics device, and might cause the device to
      segfault.

    ? Sweave() with concordance=TRUE could lead to invalid PDF files;
      Sweave.sty has been updated to avoid this.

    ? Non-ASCII characters in the titles of help pages were not
      rendered properly in some locales, and could cause errors or
      warnings.

    ? checkRd() gave a spurious error if the \href macro was used.

This is to announce that we plan to release R version 2.13.1 on Friday,
July 8, 2011. 

The 2.13.0 release has been quite solid, but some people expect an x.y.1 to roll out on larger installations for the next academic year. Of course, there have also been a sampling of minor bug fixes.  

Those directly involved should review the generic schedule at
http://developer.r-project.org/release-checklist.html

(We are breaking the schedule a little this time because of traveling.)

The source tarballs will be made available daily (barring build
troubles) via

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

R News

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.13.1:

  NEW FEATURES:

    ? iconv() no longer translates NA strings as "NA".

    ? persp(box = TRUE) now warns if the surface extends outside the
      box (since occlusion for the box and axes is computed assuming
      the box is a bounding box). (PR#202.)

    ? RShowDoc() can now display the licences shipped with R, e.g.
      RShowDoc("GPL-3").

    ? New wrapper function showNonASCIIfile() in package tools.

    ? nobs() now has a "mle" method in package stats4.

    ? trace() now deals correctly with S4 reference classes and
      corresponding reference methods (e.g., $trace()) have been added.

    ? xz has been updated to 5.0.3 (very minor bugfix release).

    ? tools::compactPDF() gets more compression (usually a little,
      sometimes a lot) by using the compressed object streams of PDF
      1.5.

    ? cairo_ps(onefile = TRUE) generates encapsulated EPS on platforms
      with cairo >= 1.6.

    ? Binary reads (e.g. by readChar() and readBin()) are now supported
      on clipboard connections.  (Wish of PR#14593.)

    ? as.POSIXlt.factor() now passes ... to the character method
      (suggestion of Joshua Ulrich).  [Intended for R 2.13.0 but
      accidentally removed before release.]

    ? vector() and its wrappers such as integer() and double() now warn
      if called with a length argument of more than one element.  This
      helps track down user errors such as calling double(x) instead of
      as.double(x).

  INSTALLATION:

    ? Building the vignette PDFs in packages grid and utils is now part
      of running make from an SVN checkout on a Unix-alike: a separate
      make vignettes step is no longer required.

      These vignettes are now made with keep.source = TRUE and hence
      will be laid out differently.

    ? make install-strip failed under some configuration options.

    ? Packages can customize non-standard installation of compiled code
      via a src/install.libs.R script. This allows packages that have
      architecture-specific binaries (beyond the package's shared
      objects/DLLs) to be installed in a multi-architecture setting.

  SWEAVE & VIGNETTES:

    ? Sweave() and Stangle() gain an encoding argument to specify the
      encoding of the vignette sources if the latter do not contain a
      \usepackage[]{inputenc} statement specifying a single input
      encoding.

    ? There is a new Sweave option figs.only = TRUE to run each figure
      chunk only for each selected graphics device, and not first using
      the default graphics device.  This will become the default in R
      2.14.0.

    ? Sweave custom graphics devices can have a custom function
      foo.off() to shut them down.

    ? Warnings are issued when non-portable filenames are found for
      graphics files (and chunks if split = TRUE).  Portable names are
      regarded as alphanumeric plus hyphen, underscore, plus and hash
      (periods cause problems with recognizing file extensions).

    ? The Rtangle() driver has a new option show.line.nos which is by
      default false; if true it annotates code chunks with a comment
      giving the line number of the first line in the sources (the
      behaviour of R >= 2.12.0).

    ? Package installation tangles the vignette sources: this step now
      converts the vignette sources from the vignette/package encoding
      to the current encoding, and records the encoding (if not ASCII)
      in a comment line at the top of the installed .R file.

  LICENCE:

    ? No parts of R are now licensed solely under GPL-2.  The licences
      for packages rpart and survival have been changed, which means
      that the licence terms for R as distributed are GPL-2 | GPL-3.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    ? The internal functions .readRDS() and .saveRDS() are now
      deprecated in favour of the public functions readRDS() and
      saveRDS() introduced in R 2.13.0.

    ? Switching off lazy-loading of code _via_ the LazyLoad field of
      the DESCRIPTION file is now deprecated.  In future all packages
      will be lazy-loaded.

    ? The off-line help() types "postscript" and "ps" are deprecated.

  UTILITIES:

    ? R CMD check on a multi-architecture installation now skips the
      user's .Renviron file for the architecture-specific tests (which
      do read the architecture-specific Renviron.site files).  This is
      consistent with single-architecture checks, which use
      --no-environ.

    ? R CMD build now looks for DESCRIPTION fields BuildResaveData and
      BuildKeepEmpty for per-package overrides.  See ?Writing R
      Extensions?.

  BUG FIXES:

    ? plot.lm(which = 5) was intended to order factor levels in
      increasing order of mean standardized residual.  It ordered the
      factor labels correctly, but could plot the wrong group of
      residuals against the label.  (PR#14545)

    ? mosaicplot() could clip the factor labels, and could overlap them
      with the cells if a non-default value of cex.axis was used.
      (Related to PR#14550.)

    ? dataframe[[row,col]] now dispatches on [[ methods for the
      selected column (spotted by Bill Dunlap).

    ? sort.int() would strip the class of an object, but leave its
      object bit set.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)

    ? pbirthday() and qbirthday() did not implement the algorithm
      exactly as given in their reference and so were unnecessarily
      inaccurate.

      pbirthday() now solves the approximate formula analytically
      rather than using uniroot() on a discontinuous function.

      The description of the problem was inaccurate: the probability is
      a tail probablity (?2 _or more_ people share a birthday?)

    ? Complex arithmetic sometimes warned incorrectly about producing
      NAs when there were NaNs in the input.

    ? seek(origin = "current") incorrectly reported it was not
      implemented for a gzfile() connection.

    ? c(), unlist(), cbind() and rbind() could silently overflow the
      maximum vector length and cause a segfault.  (PR#14571)

    ? The fonts argument to X11(type = "Xlib") was being ignored.

    ? Reading (e.g. with readBin()) from a raw connection was not
      advancing the pointer, so successive reads would read the same
      value.  (Spotted by Bill Dunlap.)

    ? Parsed text containing embedded newlines was printed incorrectly
      by as.character.srcref().  (Reported by Hadley Wickham.)

    ? decompose() used with a series of a non-integer number of periods
      returned a seasonal component shorter than the original series.
      (Reported by Rob Hyndman.)

    ? fields = list() failed for setRefClass().  (Reported by Michael
      Lawrence.)

    ? Reference classes could not redefine an inherited field which had
      class "ANY". (Reported by Janko Thyson.)

    ? Methods that override previously loaded versions will now be
      installed and called.  (Reported by Iago Mosqueira.)

    ? addmargins() called numeric(apos) rather than
      numeric(length(apos)).

    ? The HTML help search sometimes produced bad links.  (PR#14608)

    ? Command completion will no longer be broken if tail.default() is
      redefined by the user. (Problem reported by Henrik Bengtsson.)

    ? LaTeX rendering of markup in titles of help pages has been
      improved; in particular, \eqn{} may be used there.

    ? isClass() used its own namespace as the default of the where
      argument inadvertently.

    ? Rd conversion to latex mis-handled multi-line titles (including
      cases where there was a blank line in the \title section).

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.13.2:

  NEW FEATURES:

    o mem.limits() now reports values larger than the maximum integer
      (previously documented to be reported as NA), and allows larger
      values to be set, including Inf to remove the limit.

    o The print() methods for classes "Date", "POSIXct" and "POSIXlt"
      respect the option "max.print" and so are much faster for very
      long datetime vectors.  (Suggestion of Yohan Chalabi.)

    o untar2() now works around errors generated with tar files that
      use more than the standard 6 digits for the checksum.
      (https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14654PR#14654)

    o install.packages() with Ncpus > 1 guards against simultaneous
      installation of indirect dependencies as well as direct ones.

    o Sweave now knows about a few more Windows' encodings (including
      cp1250 and cp1257) and some inputenx encodings such as koi8-r.

    o postscript(colormodel = "rgb-nogray") no longer sets the sRGB
      colorspace for each colour and so some viewers may render its
      files much faster than the default colormodel ="rgb".

    o The default for pdf(maxRasters=) has been increased from 64 to
      1000.

    o readBin() now warns if signed = FALSE is used inappropriately
      (rather than being silently ignored).

      It enforces the documented limit of 2^31-1 bytes in a single
      call.

    o PCRE has been updated to version 8.13, a bug-fix release with
      updated Unicode tables (version 6.0.0). An additional patch (r611
      from PCRE 8.20-to-be) has been added to fix a collation symbol
      recognition issue.

  INSTALLATION:

    o It is possible to build in src/extra/xdr on more platforms.
      (Needed since glibc 2.14 hides its RPC implementation.)

    o configure will find the Sun TI-RPC implementation of xdr (in
      libtirpc) provided its header files are in the search path: see
      the 'R Installation and Administration Manual'.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    o Using a broad exportPattern directive in a NAMESPACE file is no
      longer allowed to export internal objects such as .onLoad and
      .__S3MethodsTable__. .

      These are also excluded from imports, along with .First.lib.

  BUG FIXES:

    o fisher.test() had a buglet: If arguments were factors with unused
      levels, levels were dropped and you would get an error saying
      that there should be at least two levels, inconsistently with
      pre-tabulated data.  (Reported by Michael Fay).

    o package.skeleton() will no longer dump S4 objects supplied
      directly rather than in a code file.  These cannot be restored
      correctly from the dumped version.

    o Build-time expressions in help files did not have access to
      functions in the package being built (with R CMD build).

    o Because quote() did not mark its result as being in use,
      modification of the result could in some circumstances modify the
      original call.

    o Plotting pch = '.' now guarantees at least a one-pixel dot if cex
      > 0.

    o The very-rarely-used command-line option --max-vsize was
      incorrectly interpreted as a number of Vcells and not in bytes as
      documented.  (Spotted by Christophe Rhodes.)

    o The HTML generated by Rd2HTML() comes closer to being standards
      compliant.

    o filter(x, recursive = TRUE) gave incorrect results on a series
      containing NAs.  (Spotted by Bill Dunlap.)

    o Profiling stats::mle() fits with a fixed parameter was not
      supported.
      (https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14646PR#14646)

    o retracemem() was still using positional matching.
      (https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14650PR#14650)

    o The quantile method for "ecdf" objects now works and is
      documented.

    o xtabs(~ .., ..., sparse=TRUE) now also works together with an
      exclude = .. specification.

    o decompose() computed an incorrect seasonal component for time
      series with odd frequencies.

    o The pdf() device only includes the definition of the sRGB
      colorspace in the output file for the "rgb" colormodel (and not
      for "gray" nor "cmyk"): this saves ca 9KB in the output file.

    o .hasSlot() wrongly gave FALSE in some cases.

    o Sweave() with keep.source=TRUE could generate spurious NA lines
      when a chunk reference appeared last in a code chunk.

    o \Sexpr[results=rd] in an .Rd file now first tries
      parse_Rd(fragment=FALSE) to allow Rd section-level macros to be
      inserted.

    o The print() method for class "summary.aov" did not pass on
      arguments such as signif.stars when summary() was called on a
      single object.
      (https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14684PR#14684)

    o In rare cases ks.test() could return a p-value very slightly less
      than 0 by rounding error.
      (https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14671PR#14671)

    o If trunc() was called on a "POSIXlt" vector and the result was
      subsetted, all but the first element was converted to NA.
      (https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14679PR#14679)

    o cbind() and rbind() could cause memory corruption when used on a
      combination of raw and logical/integer vectors.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.14.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    o All packages must have a namespace, and one is created on
      installation if not supplied in the sources.  This means that any
      package without a namespace must be re-installed under this
      version of R (but previously-installed data-only packages without
      R code can still be used).

    o The yLineBias of the X11() and windows() families of devices has
      been changed from 0.1 to 0.2: this changes slightly the vertical
      positioning of text in the margins (including axis annotations).
      This is mainly for consistency with other devices such as
      quartz() and pdf().  (Wish of PR#14538.)

      There is a new graphics parameter "ylbias" which allows the
      y-line bias of the graphics device to be tweaked, including to
      reproduce output from earlier versions of R.

    o Labeling of the p-values in various anova tables has been
      rationalized to be either "Pr(>F)" or "Pr(>Chi)" (i.e. the
      "Pr(F)", "Pr(Chi)" and "P(>|Chi|)" variants have been
      eliminated).  Code which extracts the p value _via_ indexing by
      name may need adjustment.

    o :: can now be used for datasets made available for lazy-loading
      in packages with namespaces (which makes it consistent with its
      use for data-only packages without namespaces in earlier versions
      of R).

    o There is a new package parallel.

      It incorporates (slightly revised) copies of packages multicore
      and snow (excluding MPI, PVM and NWS clusters).  Code written to
      use the higher-level API functions in those packages should work
      unchanged (apart from changing any references to their namespaces
      to a reference to parallel, and links explicitly to multicore or
      snow on help pages).

      It also contains support for multiple RNG streams following
      L'Ecuyer _et al_ (2002), with support for both mclapply and snow
      clusters.  This replaces functions like clusterSetupRNG() from
      snow (which are not in parallel).

      The version released for R 2.14.0 contains base functionality:
      higher-level convenience functions are planned (and some are
      already available in the 'R-devel' version of R).

    o Building PDF manuals (for R itself or packages, e.g. _via_ R CMD
      check) by default requires the LaTeX package inconsolata: see the
      section on 'Making the manuals' in the 'R Installation and
      Administration Manual'.

    o axTicks(*, log=TRUE) has changed in some cases to satisfy the
      documented behavior and be consistent.

  NEW FEATURES:

    o txtProgressBar() can write to an open connection instead of the
      console.

    o Non-portable package names ending in . are no longer allowed.
      Nor are single-character package names (R was already
      disallowed).

    o regexpr() and gregexpr() with perl = TRUE allows Python-style
      named captures.  (Wish and contribution of PR#14518.)

    o The placement of 'plotmath' text in the margins of plots done by
      base graphics now makes the same vertical adjustment as ordinary
      text, so using ordinary and plotmath text on the same margin line
      will seem better aligned (but not exactly aligned, since ordinary
      text has descenders below the baseline and plotmath places them
      on the baseline).  (Related to PR#14537.)

    o sunflowerplot() now has a formula interface.  (Wish of PR#14541.)

    o iconv() has a new argument toRaw to handle encodings such as
      UTF-16 with embedded nuls (as was possible before the CHARSXP
      cache was introduced).

      It will also accept as input the type of list generated with
      toRaw = TRUE.

    o Garbage-collecting an unused input text connection no longer
      gives a warning (since it 'connects' to nothing outside R).

    o read.table() and scan() have gained a text argument, to allow
      reading data from a (possibly literal) character string.

    o optim(*, method = .) now allows method = "Brent" as an interface
      to optimize(), for use in cases such as mle() where optim() is
      used internally.

    o mosaicplot() gains a border argument.  (Wish of PR#14550.)

    o smooth.spline() gains a tol argument which controls how different
      x values need to be to be treated as distinct.  The default has
      been changed to be more reliable for inputs whose range is small
      compared to their maximum absolute value.  (Wish of PR#14452.)

    o gl() runs faster by avoiding calling factor().

    o The print() method for object.size() accepts B as well as b as an
      abbreviation for 'bytes'.

    o unlink() gains a force argument to work like rm -f and if
      possible override restrictive permissions.

    o pbirthday() and qbirthday() now use exact calculations for
      coincident = 2.

    o unzip() and unz() connections have been updated with support for
      more recent Zip64 features (including large file sizes and bzip2
      compression, but not UTF-8 file names).

      unzip() has a new option to restore file times from those
      recorded (in an unknown timezone) in the zip file.

    o update.packages() now accepts a character vector of package names
      for the oldPkgs argument.  (Suggestion of Tal Galili.)

    o The special reference class fields .self and .refClassDef are now
      read-only to prevent corrupting the object.

    o decompose() now returns the original series as part of its value,
      so it can be used (rather than reconstructed) when plotting.
      (Suggestion of Rob Hyndman.)

    o Rao's efficient score test has been implemented for glm objects.
      Specifically, the add1, drop1, and anova methods now allow test =
      "Rao".

    o If a saved workspace (e.g. .RData) contains objects that cannot
      be loaded, R will now start with an warning message and an empty
      workspace, rather than failing to start.

    o strptime() now accepts times such as 24:00 for midnight at the
      end of the day, for although these are disallowed by POSIX
      1003.1-2008, ISO 8601:2004 allows them.

    o Assignment of names() to S4 objects now checks for a
      corresponding "names" slot, and generates a warning or an error
      if that slot is not defined.  See the section on slots in
      ?Classes.

    o The default methods for is.finite(), is.infinite() and is.nan()
      now signal an error if their argument is not an atomic vector.

    o The formula method for plot() no longer places package stats on
      the search path (it loads the namespace instead).

    o There now is a genuine "function" method for plot() rather than
      the generic dispatching internally to graphics::plot.function().
      It is now exported, so can be called directly as plot.function().

    o The one-sided ks.test() allows exact = TRUE to be specified in
      the presence of ties (but the approximate calculation remains the
      default: the 'exact' computation makes assumptions known to be
      invalid in the presence of ties).

    o The behaviour of curve(add = FALSE) has changed: it now no longer
      takes the default x limits from the previous plot (if any):
      rather they default to c(0, 1) just as the "function" method for
      plot().  To get the previous behaviour use curve(add = NA), which
      also takes the default for log-scaling of the x-axis from the
      previous plot.

    o Both curve() and the plot() method for functions have a new
      argument xname to facilitate plots such as sin(t) _vs_ t.

    o The local argument to source() can specify an environment as well
      as TRUE (parent.env()) and FALSE (.GlobalEnv).  It gives better
      error messages for other values, such as NA.

    o vcov() gains methods for classes "summary.lm" and "summary.glm".

    o The plot() method for class "profile.nls" gains ylab and lty
      arguments, and passes ... on to plot.default.

    o Character-string arguments such as the mode argument of vector(),
      as.vector() and is.vector() and the description argument of
      file() are required to be of length exactly one, rather than any
      further elements being silently discarded.  This helps catch
      incorrect usage in programming.

    o The length argument of vector() and its wrappers such as
      numeric() is required to be of length exactly one (other values
      are now an error rather than giving a warning as previously).

    o vector(len) and length(x) <- len no longer acccept TRUE/FALSE for
      len (not that they were ever documented to, but there was
      special-casing in the C code).

    o There is a new function Sys.setFileTime() to set the time of a
      file (including a directory).  See its help for exactly which
      times it sets on various OSes.

    o The file times reported by file.info() are reported to sub-second
      resolution on systems which support it.  (Currently the POSIX
      2008 and FreeBSD/Darwin/NetBSD methods are detected.)

    o New function getCall(m) as an abstraction for m$call, enabling
      update()'s default method to apply more universally.  (NB: this
      can be masked by existing functions in packages.)

    o Sys.info() gains a euser component to report the 'effective' user
      on OSes which have that concept.

    o The result returned by try() now contains the original error
      condition object as the "condition" attribute.

    o All packages with R code are lazy-loaded irrespective of the
      LazyLoad field in the DESCRIPTION file.  A warning is given if
      the LazyLoad field is overridden.

    o Rd markup has a new \figure tag so that figures can be included
      in help pages when converted to HTML or LaTeX.  There are
      examples on the help pages for par() and points().

    o The built-in httpd server now allows access to files in the
      session temporary directory tempdir(), addressed as the /session
      directory on the httpd server.

    o Development versions of R are no longer referred to by the number
      under which they might be released, e.g. in the startup banner, R
      --version and sessionUtils().  The correct way to refer to a
      development version of R is 'R-devel', preferably with the date
      and SVN version number.
      E.g. R-devel (2011-07-04 r56266)

    o There is a new function texi2pdf() in package tools, currently a
      convenience wrapper for texi2dvi(pdf = TRUE).

    o There are two new options for typesetting PDF manuals from Rd
      files.  These are beramono and inconsolata, and used the named
      font for monospaced output. They are intended to be used in
      combination with times, and times,inconsolata,hyper is now the
      default for the reference manual and package manuals.  If you do
      not have that font installed, you can set R_RD4PF to one of the
      other options: see the 'R Installation and Administration
      Manual'.

    o Automatic printing for reference classes is now done by the
      $show() method.  A method is defined for class envRefClass and
      may be overriden for user classes (see the ?ReferenceClasses
      example).  S4 show() methods should no longer be needed for
      reference classes.

    o tools::Rdiff (by default) and R CMD Rdiff now ignore differences
      in pointer values when comparing printed environments, compiled
      byte code, etc.

    o The "source" attribute on functions created with keep.source=TRUE
      has been replaced with a "srcref" attribute.  The "srcref"
      attribute references an in-memory copy of the source file using
      the "srcfilecopy" class or the new "srcfilealias" class.

    o New items User Manuals and Technical Papers have been added to
      the HTML help main page.  These link to vignettes in the base and
      recommended packages and to a collection of papers about R
      issues, respectively.

    o Documentation and messages have been standardized to use
      "namespace" rather than "name space".

    o setGeneric() now looks in the default packages for a non-generic
      version of a function if called from a package with a namespace.
      (It always did for packages without a namespace.)

    o Setting the environment variable _R_WARN_ON_LOCKED_BINDINGS_ will
      give a warning if an attempt is made to change a locked binding.

    o \SweaveInput is now supported when generating concordances in
      Sweave().

    o findLineNum() and setBreakpoint() now allow the environment to be
      specified indirectly; the latter gains a clear argument to allow
      it to call untrace().

    o The body of a closure can be one of further types of R objects,
      including enviroments and external pointers.

    o The Rd2HTML() function in package tools now has a stylesheet
      argument, allowing pages to be displayed in alternate formats.

    o New function requireNamespace() analogous to require(), returning
      a logical value after attempting to load a namespace.

    o There is a new type of RNG, "L'Ecuyer-CMRG", implementing
      L'Ecuyer (1999)'s 'combined multiple-recursive generator'
      MRG32k3a.  See the comments on ?RNG.

    o help.search() and ?? can now display vignettes and demos as well
      as help pages.  The new option "help.search.types" controls the
      types of documentation and the order of their display.

      This also applies to HTML searches, which now give results in all
      of help pages, vignettes and demos.

    o socketConnection() now has a timeout argument.  It is now
      documented that large values (package snow used a year) do not
      work on some OSes.

    o The initialization of the random-number generator now uses the
      process ID as well as the current time, just in case two R
      processes are launched very rapidly on a machine with
      low-resolution wall clock (some have a resolution of a second;
      modern systems have microsecond-level resolution).

    o New function pskill() in the tools package to send a terminate
      signal to one or more processes, plus constants such as SIGTERM
      to provide a portable way to refer to signals (since the numeric
      values are OS-dependent).

    o New function psnice() in the tools package to return or change
      the 'niceness' of a process.  (Refers to the 'priority class' on
      Windows.)

    o list.dirs() gains a recursive argument.

    o An Authors at R field in a package DESCRIPTION file can now be used
      to generate Author and Maintainer fields if needed, and to
      auto-generate package citations.

    o New utility getElement() for accessing either a list component or
      a slot in an S4 object.

    o stars() gains a col.lines argument, thanks to Dustin Sallings.
      (Wish of PR#14657.)

    o New function regmatches() for extracting or replacing matched or
      non-matched substrings from match data obtained by regexpr(),
      gregexpr() and regexec().

    o help(package = "pkg_name", help_type = "HTML") now gives HTML
      help on the package rather than text help.  (This gives direct
      access to the HTML version of the package manual shown _via_
      help.start()'s 'Packages' menu.)

    o agrep() gains a fixed argument to optionally allow approximate
      regular expression matching, and a costs argument to specify
      possibly different integer match costs for insertions, deletions
      and substitutions.

    o read.dcf() and write.dcf() gain a keep.white argument to indicate
      fields where whitespace should be kept as is.

    o available.packages() now works around servers that fail to return
      an error code when PACKAGES.gz does not exist.  (Patch submitted
      by Seth Schommer.)

    o readBin() can now read more than 2^31 - 1 bytes in a single call
      (the previously documented limitation).

    o New function regexec() for finding the positions of matches as
      well as all substrings corresponding to parenthesized
      subexpressions of the given regular expression.

    o New function adist() in package utils for computing 'edit'
      (generalized Levenshtein) distances between strings.

    o Class "raster" gains an is.na method to avoid confusion from the
      misuse of the matrix method (such as PR#14618).

    o The identical() function gains an ignore.bytecode argument to
      control comparison of compiled functions.

    o pmin and pmax now warn if an argument is partially recycled (wish
      of PR#14638).

    o The default for image(useRaster=) is now taken from option
      "preferRaster": for the small print see ?image.

    o str() now displays reference class objects and their fields,
      rather than treating them as classical S4 classes.

    o New function aregexec() in package utils for finding the
      positions of approximate string matches as well as all substrings
      corresponding to parenthesized subexpressions of the given
      regular expression.

    o download.file() has an extra argument to pass additional
      command-line options to the non-default methods using
      command-line utilities.

      cacheOK = FALSE is now supported for method = "curl".

    o interaction.plot(*, type = .) now also allows type "o" or "c".

    o axTicks(*, log=TRUE) did sometimes give more values than the
      ticks in the corresponding graphics::axis().  By default, it now
      makes use of the new (graphics-package independent) axisTicks()
      which can make use of a new utility .axisPars().  Further, it now
      returns a decreasing sequence (as for log=FALSE) when usr is
      decreasing.

    o Using fix() or edit() on a R object (except perhaps a matrix or
      data frame) writes its temporary file with extension .R so
      editors which select their mode based on the extension will
      select a suitable mode.

  GRAPHICS DEVICES:

    o The pdf() device makes use of Flate compression: this is
      controlled by the new logical argument compress, and is enabled
      by default.

    o Devices svg(), cairo_pdf() and cairo_ps() gain a family argument.

      On a Unix-alike X11() gains a family argument.  This is one of
      the x11.options() and so can be passed as an argument to the
      bmp(), jpeg(), png() and tiff() devices.

      Analogous changes have been made on Windows, so all built-in R
      graphics devices now have a family argument except pictex()
      (which has no means to change fonts).

    o The bmp(), jpeg(), png() and tiff() devices now make use of the
      antialias argument for type = "quartz".

    o There are several new built-in font mappings for X11(type =
      "Xlib"): see the help on X11Fonts().

    o There is a new type X11(type = "dbcairo") which updates the
      screeen less frequently: see its help page.

    o The X11() device now makes use of cursors to distinguish its
      states.  The normal cursor is an arrow (rather than a crosshair);
      the crosshair is used when the locator is in use, and a watch
      cursor is shown when plotting computations are being done.
      (These are the standard names for X11 cursors: how they are
      actually displayed depends on the window manager.)

    o New functions dev.hold() and dev.flush() for use with graphics
      devices with buffering.  These are used for most of the
      high-level graphics functions such as boxplot(), so that the plot
      is only displayed when the page is complete.

      Currently implemented for windows(buffered = TRUE), quartz() and
      the cairographics-based X11() types with buffering (which are the
      default on-screen devices).

    o New function dev.capture() for capture of bitmap snapshots of
      image-based devices (a superset of the functionality provided by
      grid.cap() in grid).

    o The default colormodel for pdf() and postscript() is now called
      "srgb" to more accurately describe it.  (Instead of "rgb", and in
      the case of postscript() it no longer switches to and from the
      gray colorspace, by default.)

      The colormodel for postscript() which does use both gray and sRGB
      colorspaces is now called "srgb+gray".

      Plots which are known to use only black/white/transparent can
      advantageously use colormodel = "gray" (just as before, but there
      is now slightly more advantage in doing so).

    o postscript() with values colormodel = "rgb" and colormodel =
      "rgb-nogray" give the behaviour prior to R 2.13.0 of uncalibrated
      RGB, which under some circumstances can be rendered much faster
      by a viewer.

      pdf(colormodel = "rgb") gives the behaviour prior to R 2.13.0 of
      uncalibrated RGB, which under some circumstances can be rendered
      faster by a viewer, and the files will be smaller (by about 9KB
      if compression is not used).

    o The postscript() device only includes the definition of the sRGB
      colorspace in the output file for the colormodels which use it.

    o The postscript() and pdf() devices now output greyscale raster
      images (and not RGB) when colormodel = "gray".

    o postscript(colormodel = "gray") now accepts non-grey colours and
      uses their luminance (as pdf() long has).

    o colormodel = "grey" is allowed as an alternative name for
      postscript() and pdf().

    o pdf() in the default sRGB colorspace outputs many fewer changes
      of colorspace, which may speed up rendering in some viewing
      applications.

    o There is a new function dev.capabilities() to query the
      capabilities of the current device.  The initial set of
      capabilities are support for semi-transparent colours, rendering
      and capturing raster images, the locator and for interactive
      events.

    o For pdf(), maxRasters is increased as needed so the argument is
      no longer used.

  SWEAVE & VIGNETTES:

    o Options keep.source = TRUE, figs.only = FALSE are now the
      default.

    o The way the type of user-defined options is determined has
      changed.  Previously they were all regarded as logical: now the
      type is determined by the value given at first use.

    o The allowed values of logical options are now precisely those
      allowed for character inputs to as.logical(): this means that t
      and f are no longer allowed (although T and F still are).

    o The preferred location for vignette sources is now the directory
      vignettes and not inst/doc: R CMD build will now re-build
      vignettes in directory vignettes and copy the .Rnw (etc) files
      and the corresponding PDFs to inst/doc.  Further files to be
      copied to inst/doc can be specified _via_ the file
      vignettes/.install_extras.

    o R CMD Sweave now supports a --driver option to select the Sweave
      driver: the default is equivalent to --driver=RweaveLatex.

    o R CMD Sweave and R CMD Stangle support options --encoding and
      --options.

    o The Rtangle() driver allows output = "stdout" or output =
      "stderr" to select the output or message connection.  This is
      convenient for scripting using something like

          R CMD Stangle --options='output="stdout"' foo.Rnw > foo2.R

    o There is a new option pdf.compress controlling whether PDF
      figures are generated using Flate compression (they are by
      default).

    o R CMD Sweave now has a --pdf option to produce a PDF version of
      the processed Sweave document.

    o It is no longer allowed to have two vignettes with the same
      vignette basename (e.g. vig.Rnw and vig.Snw).  (Previously one
      vignette hid the other in the vignette() function.)

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    o Function R_tmpnam2 has been added to the API to allow a temporary
      filename to include a specified extension.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    o Package DESCRIPTION file field KeepSource forces the package to
      be installed with keep.source = TRUE (or FALSE).  (Suggestion of
      Greg Snow.  Note that as all packages are lazy-loaded, this is
      now only relevant at installation.)

      There are corresponding options --with-keep.source and
      --without-keep.source for R CMD INSTALL.

    o R CMD INSTALL has a new option --byte-compile to byte-compile the
      packages during installation (since all packages are now
      lazy-loaded).  This can be controlled on a per-package basis by
      the optional field ByteCompile in the DESCRIPTION file.

    o A package R code but without a NAMESPACE file will have a default
      one created at R CMD build or R CMD INSTALL time, so all packages
      will be installed with namespaces.  A consequence of this is that
      .First.lib() functions need to be copied to .onLoad() (usually)
      or .onAttach().  For the time being, if there is an
      auto-generated NAMESPACE file and no .onLoad() nor .onAttach()
      function is found but .First.lib() is, it will be run as the
      attach hook (unless the package is one of a list of known
      exceptions, when it will be run as the load hook).

    o A warning is given if test-loading a package changes a locked
      binding in a package other than itself.  It is likely that this
      will be disallowed in future releases.  (There are _pro tem_ some
      exceptions to the warning.)

    o A dependency on SVN revision is allowed for R, e.g. R (>=
      r56550).  This should be used in conjunction with a version
      number, e.g. R (>= 2.14.0), R (>= r56550) to distinguish beteen
      R-patched and R-devel versions with the same SVN revision.

    o installed.packages() now hashes the names of its cache files to
      avoid very rare problems with excessively long path names.
      (PR#14669)

    o A top-level COPYING file in a package is no longer installed
      (file names LICENSE or LICENCE having long been preferred).

  UTILITIES:

    o R CMD check now gives an error if the R code in a vignette fails
      to run, unless this is caused by a missing package.

    o R CMD check now unpacks tarballs in the same way as R CMD
      INSTALL, including making use of the environment variable
      R_INSTALL_TAR to override the default behaviour.

    o R CMD check performs additional code analysis of package startup
      functions, and notifies about incorrect argument lists and
      (incorrect) calls to functions which modify the search path or
      inappropriately generate messages.

    o R CMD check now also checks compiled code for symbols
      corresponding to functions which might terminate R or write to
      stdout/stderr instead of the console.

    o R CMD check now uses a pdf() device when checking examples
      (rather than postscript()).

    o R CMD check now checks line-endings of makefiles and
      C/C++/Fortran sources in subdirectories of src as well as in src
      itself.

    o R CMD check now reports as a NOTE what look like methods
      documented with their full names even if there is a namespace and
      they are exported.  In almost all cases they are intended to be
      used only as methods and should use the \method markup.  In the
      other rare cases the recommended form is to use a function such
      as coefHclust which would not get confused with a method,
      document that and register it in the NAMESPACE file by
      s3method(coef, hclust, coefHclust).

    o The default for the environment variable _R_CHECK_COMPACT_DATA2_
      is now true: thus if using the newer forms of compression
      introduced in R 2.10.0 would be beneficial is now checked (by
      default).

    o Reference output for a vignette can be supplied when checking a
      package by R CMD check: see 'Writing R Extensions'.

    o R CMD Rd2dvi allows the use of LaTeX package inputenx rather than
      inputenc: the value of the environment variable RD2DVI_INPUTENC
      is used.  (LaTeX package inputenx is an optional install which
      provides greater coverage of the UTF-8 encoding.)

    o Rscript on a Unix-alike now accepts file names containing spaces
      (provided these are escaped or quoted in the shell).

    o R CMD build on a Unix-alike (only) now tries to preserve dates on
      files it copies from its input directory.  (This was the
      undocumented behaviour prior to R 2.13.0.)

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    o require() no longer has a save argument.

    o The gamma argument to hsv(), rainbow(), and rgb2hsv() has been
      removed.

    o The --no-docs option for R CMD build --binary is defunct: use
      --install-args instead.

    o The option --unsafe to R CMD INSTALL is defunct: use the
      identical option --no-lock instead.

    o The entry point pythag formerly in Rmath.h is defunct: use
      instead the C99 function hypot.

    o R CMD build --binary is formally defunct: R CMD INSTALL --build
      has long been the preferred alternative.

    o zip.file.extract() is now defunct: use unzip() or unz() instead.

    o R CMD Rd2dvi without the --pdf option is now deprecated: only PDF
      output will be supported in future releases (since this allows
      the use of fonts only supported for PDF), and only R CMD Rd2pdf
      will be available.

    o Options such as --max-nsize and the function mem.limits() are now
      deprecated: these limits are nowadays almost never used, and are
      reported by gc() when they are in use.

    o Forms like binomial(link = "link") for GLM families deprecated
      since R 2.4.0 are now defunct.

    o The declarativeOnly argument to loadNamespace() (not relevant
      since R 2.13.0) has been removed.

    o Use of library.dynam() without specifying all the first three
      arguments is deprecated.  (It is often called from a namespace,
      and the defaults are only appropriate to a package.)

      Use of chname in library.dynam() with the extension .so or .dll
      (which is clearly not allowed according to the help page) is
      deprecated.  This also applies to library.dynam.unload() and
      useDynLib directives in NAMESPACE files.

    o It is deprecated to use mean(x) and sd(x) directly on data frames
      (or also matrices, for sd) x, instead of simply using sapply.

      In the same spirit, median(x) now gives an error for a data frame
      x (it often gave nonsensical results).

    o The keep.source argument to library() and require() is
      deprecated: it was only used for packages installed without
      lazy-loading, and now all packages are lazy-loaded.

    o Using a false value for the DESCRIPTION field LazyLoad is
      deprecated.

  INSTALLATION:

    o The base and recommended packages are now byte-compiled
      (equivalent to make bytecode in R 2.13.x).

    o Configure option --with-system-zlib now only makes use of the
      basic interface of zlib and not the C function gzseek which has
      shown erroneous behaviour in zlib 1.2.4 and 1.2.5.

    o The zlib in the R sources is now version 1.2.5.  (This is safe
      even on 32-bit Linux systems because only the basic interface is
      now used.)

    o The .afm files in package grDevices are now installed as
      compressed files (as long done on Windows), saving ca 2MB on the
      installed size.

    o The non-screen cairo-based devices are no longer in the X11
      module and so can be installed without X11.  (We have never seen
      a Unix-alike system with cairographics installed but not X11, but
      a user might select --without-x.)

    o Configure will try to use -fobjc-exceptions for the Objective-C
      compiler (if present) to ensure that even compilers that do not
      enable exceptions by default (such as vanilla gcc) can be used.
      (Objective-C is currently only used on Mac OS X.)

    o The system call times is required.

    o The C99 functions acosh, asinh, atanh, snprintf and vsnprintf are
      now required.

    o There is no longer support for making DVI manuals _via_ make dvi,
      make install-dvi and similar.  Only PDF manuals are supported (to
      allow the use of fonts which are only available for PDF.)

    o The configure arguments used during configuration of R are
      included as a comment in Makeconf for informative purposes on
      Unix-alikes in a form suitable for shell execution.  Note that
      those are merely command-line arguments, they do not include
      environment variables (one more reason to use configure variables
      instead) or site configuration settings.

    o Framework installation now supports DESTDIR (Mac OS X only).

    o Java detection (R CMD javareconf) works around bogus
      java.library.path property in recent Oracle Java binaries.

  BUG FIXES:

    o The locale category LC_MONETARY was only being set on startup on
      Windows: that is now done on Unix-alikes where supported.

    o Reference class utilities will detect an attempt to modify
      methods or fields in a locked class definition (e.g., in a
      namespace) and generate an error.

    o The formula methods for lines(), points() and text() now work
      even if package stats is not on the search path.

    o In principle, S4 classes from different packages could have the
      same name.  This has not previously worked.  Changes have now
      been installed that should allow such classes and permit methods
      to use them.  New functions className() and multipleClasses() are
      related tools for programming.

    o Work around an issue in Linux (a system select call resetting tv)
      which prevented internet operations from timing out properly.

    o Several stack trampling and overflow issues have been fixed in
      TRE, triggered by agrep and friends with long patterns.
      (PR#14627.)

    o ("design infelicity") Field assignments in reference classes are
      now consistent with slots in S4 classes: the assigned value must
      come from the declared class (if any) for the field or from a
      subclass.

    o The methods objects constructed for "coerce" and "coerce<-" were
      lacking some essential information in the generic, defined and
      target slots; as() did not handle duplicate class definitions
      correctly.

    o The parser no longer accepts the digit 8 in an octal character
      code in a string, nor does it accept unterminated strings in a
      file.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)

    o The print() method for class "summary.aov" did not pass on
      argument digits when summary() was called on a single object, and
      hence used more digits than documented.

    o The X11() device's cairo back-end produced incorrect capture
      snapshot images on big-endian machines.

    o loglin() gave a spurious error when argument margin consisted of
      a single element of length one.  (PR#14690)

    o loess() is better protected against misuse, e.g. zero-length
      span.  (PR#14691)

    o HoltWinters() checks that the optimization succeeded. (PR#14694)

    o The (undocumented) inclusion of superclass objects in default
      initializing of reference classes overwrote explicit field
      arguments. The bug is fixed, the feature documented and a test
      added.

    o round(x, -Inf) now does something sensible (return zero rather
      than NA).

    o signif(x, -Inf) now behaves as documented (signif(x, 1)) rather
      than giving zero.

    o The "table" method for Axis() hardcoded side = 1, hence calls to
      plot(<vector>, <table>) labelled the wrong axis. (PR#14699)

    o Creating a connection might fail under gctorture(TRUE).

    o stack() and unstack() converted character columns to factors.

      unstack() sometimes produced incorrect results (a list or a
      vector) if the factor on which to un-split had only one level.

    o On some systems help(".C", help_type = "pdf") and similar
      generated file names that TeX was unable to handle.

    o Non-blocking listening socket connections continued to report
      isIncomplete() as true even when the peer had closed down and all
      available input had been read.

    o The revised HTML search system now generates better hyperlinks to
      help topics found: previously it gave problems with help pages
      with names containing e.g. spaces and slashes.

    o A late change in R 2.13.2 broke \Sexpr expressions in Rd files.

    o The creation of ticks on log axes (including axTicks() sometimes
      incorrectly omitted a tick at one end

    o The creation of ticks on log axes (including by axTicks())
      sometimes incorrectly omitted a tick at one end of the range by
      rounding error in a platform-dependent way.  This could be seen
      in the examples for axTicks(), where with axis limits c(0.2, 88)
      the tick for 0.2 was sometimes omitted.

    o qgamma() for small shape underflows to 0 rather than sometimes
      giving NaN.  (PR#8528, PR#14710)

    o mapply() now gives an explicit error message (rather than an
      obscure one) is inputs of zero and positive length are mixed.

    o Setting a Hershey font family followed by string height query
      would crash R.

    o R CMD javareconf -e would fail for some shells due to a shift
      error. Also the resulting paths will no longer contain
      $(JAVA_HOME) as that can result in an unintended substitution
      based on Makeconf instead of the shell setting.

Subject: Windows binary of 2.14.0
Message-ID: <4EB050A4.2080803@gmail.com>

To all Windows users:

The binary build of 2.14.0 that was uploaded yesterday was missing Cairo 
support.  I have rebuilt it, and uploaded a new copy.

You can tell which one you have by running "svg()", which works on the 
new one, but not the old one.

You can tell which one is on your CRAN mirror by looking at the last 
changed date:  it is today (November 1) for the corrected build.

Sorry for the inconvenience....

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file (yes, I _have_ spotted the minor mishap....):

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.14.0 patched:

  NEW FEATURES:

    o parallel::detectCores() is now able to find the number of
      physical cores (rather than CPUs) on Sparc Solaris.

      It can also do so on most versions of Windows; however the
      default remains detectCores(logical = TRUE) on that platform.

    o Reference classes now keep a record of which fields are locked.
      $lock() with no arguments returns the names of the locked fields.

    o HoltWinters() reports a warning rather than an error for some
      optimization failures (where the answer might be a reasonable
      one).

    o tools::dependsOnPkg() now accepts the shorthand dependencies =
      "all".

    o parallel::clusterExport() now allows specification of an
      environment from which to export.

    o The quartz() device now does tilde expansion on its file
      argument.

    o tempfile() on a Unix-alike now takes the process ID into account.
      This is needed with multicore (and as part of parallel) because
      the parent and all the children share a session temporary
      directory, and they can share the C random number stream used to
      produce the uniaue part.  Further, two children can call
      tempfile() simultaneously.

    o Option print in Sweave's RweaveLatex() driver now emulates
      auto-printing rather than printing (which can differ for an S4
      object by calling show() rather than print()).

    o filled.contour() now accepts infinite values: previously it might
      have generated invalid graphics files (e.g. containing NaN
      values).

  INSTALLATION:

    o On 64-bit Linux systems, configure now only sets LIBnn to lib64
      if /usr/lib64 exists.  This may obviate setting LIBnn explicitly
      on Debian-derived systems.

      It is still necessary to set LIBnn = lib (or lib32) for 32-bit
      builds of R on a 64-bit OS on those Linux distributions capable
      for supporting that concept.

    o configure looks for inconsolata.sty, and if not found adjusts the
      default R_RD4PDF to not use it (with a warning, since it is
      needed for high-quality rendering of manuals).

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    o R CMD INSTALL will now do a test load for all sub-architectures
      for which code was compiled (rather than just the primary
      sub-architecture).

  UTILITIES:

    o When checking examples under more than one sub-architecture, R
      CMD check now uses a separate directory examples_arch for each
      sub-architecture, and leaves the output in file
      pkgname-Ex_arch.Rout.  Some packages expect their examples to be
      run in a clean directory ....

  BUG FIXES:

    o stack() now gives an error if no vector column is selected,
      rather than returning a 1-column data frame (contrary to its
      documentation).

    o summary.mlm() did not handle objects where the formula had been
      specified by an expression.  (Reported by Helios de Rosario
      Martinez).

    o tools::deparseLatex(dropBraces=TRUE) could drop text as well as
      braces.

    o colormodel = "grey" (new in R 2.14.0)) did not always work in
      postscript() and pdf().

    o file.append() could return TRUE for failures.  (PR#14727)

    o gzcon() connections are no longer subject to garbage collection:
      it was possible for this to happen when unintended (e.g. when
      calling load()).

    o nobs() does not count zero-weight observations for glm() fits,
      for consistency with lm().  This affects the BIC() values
      reported for such glm() fits.  (Spotted by Bill Dunlap.)

    o options(warn = 0) failed to end a (C-level) context with more
      than 50 accumulated warnings.  (Spotted by Jeffery Horner.)

    o The internal plot.default() code did not do sanity checks on a
      cex argument, so invalid input could cause problems.  (Reported
      by Ben Bolker.)

    o anyDuplicated(<array>, MARGIN=0) no longer fails.  (Reported by
      Herv'e Pag`es.)

    o read.dcf() removes trailing blanks: unfortunately on some
      platforms this included \xa0 (non-breaking space) which is the
      trailing byte of a UTF-8 character.  It now only considers ASCII
      space and tab to be 'blank'.

    o There was a sign error in part of the calculations for the
      variance returned by KalmanSmooth().  (PR#14738)

    o pbinom(10, 1e6, 0.01, log.p = TRUE) was NaN thanks to the buggy
      fix to PR#14320 in R 2.11.0.  (PR#14739)

    o RweaveLatex() now emulates auto-printing rather than printing, by
      calling methods::show() when auto-printing would.

    o duplicated() ignored fromLast for a one-column data frame.
      (PR#14742)

    o source() and related functions did not put the correct timestamp
      on the source references; srcfilecopy() has gained a new argument
      timestamp to support this fix. (PR#14750)

    o LaTeX conversion of Rd files did not correctly handle
      preformatted backslashes.  (PR#14751)

    o HTML conversion of Rd files did not handle markup within tabular
      cells properly.  (PR#14708)

    o source() on an empty file with keep.source = TRUE tried to read
      from stdin(), in R 2.14.0 only.  (PR#14753)

    o The code to check Rd files in packages would abort if duplicate
      description sections were present.
