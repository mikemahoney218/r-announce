CHANGES IN R 3.1.3:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The internal method of download.file() can now handle files
      larger than 2GB on 32-bit builds which support such files (tested
      on 32-bit R running on 64-bit Windows).

    * kruskal.test() warns on more types of suspicious input.

    * The as.dendrogram() method for "hclust" objects gains a check
      argument protecting against memory explosion for invalid inputs.

    * capabilities() has a new item long.double which indicates if the
      build uses a long double type which is longer than double.

    * nlm() no longer modifies the callback argument in place (a new
      vector is allocated for each invocation, which mimics the
      implicit duplication that occurred in R < 3.1.0); note that this
      is a change from the previously documented behavior. (PR#15958)

    * icuSetCollate() now accepts locale = "ASCII" which uses the basic
      C function strcmp and so collates strings byte-by-byte in
      numerical order.

    * sessionInfo() tries to report the OS version in use (not just
      that compiled under, and including details of Linux
      distributions).

    * model.frame() (used by lm() and many other modelling functions)
      now warns when it drops contrasts from factors.  (Wish of
      PR#16119)

    * install.packages() and friends now accept the value type =
      "binary" as a synonym for the native binary type on the platform
      (if it has one).

    * Single source or binary files can be supplied for
      install.packages(type = "both") and the appropriate type and
      repos = NULL will be inferred.

    * New function pcre_config() to report on some of the configuration
      options of the version of PCRE in use.  In particular, this
      reports if regular expressions using \p{xx} are supported.

    * (Windows.) download.file(cacheOK = FALSE) is now supported when
      internet2.dll is used.

    * browseURL() has been updated to work with Firefox 36.0 which has
      dropped support for the -remote interface.

  INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

    * The included version of PCRE has been updated to 8.36.

    * configure accepts MAKEINFO=texi2any as another way to ensure
      texinfo 5.x is used when both 5.x and 4.x are installed.

  UTILITIES:

    * R CMD check now checks the packages used in \donttest sections of
      the examples are specified in the DESCRIPTION file.  (These are
      needed to run the examples interactively.)

    * R CMD check checks for the undeclared use of GNU extensions in
      Makefiles, and for Makefiles with a missing final linefeed.

      R CMD build will correct line endings in all Makefiles, not just
      those in the src directory.

    * R CMD check notes uses of library() and require() in package
      code: see the section 'Suggested packages' of 'Writing R
      Extensions' for good practice.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * The configure option --with-valgrind-instrumentation=3 is
      deprecated and will be removed in R 3.2.0.

  BUG FIXES:

    * (Windows.) Rscript.exe was missing a manifest specifying the
      modern style for common controls (e.g., the download progress
      bar).

    * If a package had extra documentation files but no vignette, the
      HTML help system produced an empty index page.

    * The parser now gives an error if a null character is included in
      a string using Unicode escapes. (PR#16046)

    * qr.Q() failed on complex arguments due to pre-3.0(!) typo.
      (PR#16054)

    * abs() failed with named arguments when the argument was complex.
      (PR#16047)

    * "noquote" objects may now be used as columns in dataframes.
      (PR#15997)

    * Some values with extremely long names were printed incorrectly.
      (PR#15999)

    * Extremely large exponents on zero expressed in scientific
      notation (e.g. 0.0e50000) could give NaN.  (PR#15976)

    * download.file() reported downloaded sizes as 0KB if less than
      1MB, only for R 3.1.2 and only on big-endian platforms.

    * prompt() did not escape percent signs in the automatically
      generated usage section of help files.

    * drop.terms() dropped some of the attributes of the object it was
      working with.  (PR#16029)

    * (Windows.) The command completion in Rgui.exe messed up the
      console.  (PR#15791)

    * (Windows.) The choose.files() command returned a blank string
      when the user asked for a single file but cancelled the request.
      (PR#16074)

    * Math2 S4 group generics failed to correctly dispatch "structure"-
      and "nonStructure"-derived classes.

    * loadNamespace() imposed undocumented restrictions on the
      versionCheck parameter.  (Reported by Geoff Lee.)

    * Rare over-runs detected by AddressSanitizer in substr() and its
      replacement version have been avoided.

      _Inter alia_ that fix gives the documented behaviour for
      substr(x, 1, 2) <- "" (subsequently reported as PR#16214).

    * Loading packages incorrectly defining an S4 generic followed by a
      function of the same name caused an erroneous cyclic namespace
      dependency error.

    * Declared vignette encodings are now always passed to the vignette
      engine.

    * Port Tomas Kalibera's fix from R-devel that restores the
      loadMethod() fast path, effectively doubling the speed of S4
      dispatch.

    * power.t.test() and power.prop.test() now make use of the
      extendInt option of uniroot() and hence work in more extreme
      cases.  (PR#15792)

    * If a package was updated and attached when its namespace was
      already loaded, it could end up with parts from one version and
      parts from the other.  (PR#16120)

    * tools:::.Rdconv() didn't accept --encoding= due to a typo.
      (PR#16121)

    * Unix-alike builds without a suitable makeinfo were documented to
      link the missing HTML manuals to CRAN, but did not.

    * save(*, ascii=TRUE) and load() now correctly deal with NaN's.
      (PR#16137)

    * split.Date() retains fractional representations while avoiding
      incomplete class propagation.

    * R_ext/Lapack.h had not been updated for changes made by LAPACK to
      the argument lists of its (largely internal) functions dlaed2 and
      dlaed3.  (PR#16157)

    * RShowDoc("NEWS", "txt") had not been updated for the layout
      changes of R 3.1.0.

    * The xtfrm() method for class "Surv" has been corrected and its
      description expanded.

    * mode(x) <- y would incorrectly evaluate x before changing its
      mode. (PR#16215)

    * besselJ(1, 2^64) and besselY(..) now signal a warning, returning
      NaN instead of typically segfaulting. (Issue 3 of PR#15554)

    * HTML conversion of \href markup in .Rd files did not remove the
      backslash from \% and so gave an invalid URL.  In a related
      change, the \ escape is now required in such URLs.

CHANGES IN 3.2.0:

 NEW FEATURES:

   * anyNA() gains a recursive argument.

   * When x is missing and names is not false (including the default
     value), Sys.getenv(x, names) returns an object of class "Dlist"
     and hence prints tidily.

   * (Windows.)  shell() no longer consults the environment variable
     SHELL: too many systems have been encountered where it was set
     incorrectly (usually to a path where software was compiled, not
     where it was installed).  R_SHELL, the preferred way to select a
     non-default shell, can be used instead.

   * Some unusual arguments to embedFonts() can now be specified as
     character vectors, and the defaults have been changed
     accordingly.

   * Functions in the Summary group duplicate less.  (PR#15798)

   * (Unix-alikes.) system(cmd, input = ) now uses
     'shell-execution-environment' redirection, which will be more
     natural if cmd is not a single command (but requires a
     POSIX-compliant shell). (Wish of PR#15508)

   * read.fwf() and read.DIF() gain a fileEncoding argument, for
     convenience.

   * Graphics devices can add attributes to their description in
     .Device and .Devices.  Several of those included with R use a
     "filepath" attribute.

   * pmatch() uses hashing in more cases and so is faster at the
     expense of using more memory. (PR#15697)

   * pairs() gains new arguments to select sets of variables to be
     plotted against each other.

   * file.info(, extra_cols = FALSE) allows a minimal set of columns
     to be computed on Unix-alikes: on some systems without
     properly-configured caching this can be significantly faster with
     large file lists.

   * New function dir.exists() in package base to test efficiently
     whether one or more paths exist and are directories.

   * dput() and friends gain new controls hexNumeric and digits17
     which output double and complex quantities as, respectively,
     binary fractions (exactly, see sprintf("%a")) and as decimals
     with up to 17 significant digits.

   * save(), saveRDS() and serialize() now support ascii = NA which
     writes ASCII files using sprintf("%a") for double/complex
     quantities.  This is read-compatible with ascii = TRUE but avoids
     binary->decimal->binary conversions with potential loss of
     precision.  Unfortunately the Windows C runtime's lack of C99
     compliance means that the format cannot be read correctly there
     in R before 3.1.2.

   * The default for formatC(decimal.mark =) has been changed to be
     getOption("OutDec"); this makes it more consistent with format()
     and suitable for use in print methods, e.g. those for classes
     "density", "ecdf", "stepfun" and "summary.lm".

     getOption("OutDec") is now consulted by the print method for
     class "kmeans", by cut(), dendrogram(), plot.ts() and quantile()
     when constructing labels and for the report from legend(trace =
     TRUE).

     (In part, wish of PR#15819.)

   * printNum() and hence format() and formatC() give a warning if
     big.mark and decimal.mark are set to the same value (period and
     comma are not uncommonly used for each, and this is a check that
     conventions have not got mixed).

   * merge() can create a result which uses long vectors on 64-bit
     platforms.

   * dget() gains a new argument keep.source which defaults to FALSE
     for speed (dput() and dget() are most often used for data objects
     where this can make dget() many times faster).

   * Packages may now use a file of common macro definitions in their
     help files, and may import definitions from other packages.

   * A number of macros have been added in the new share/Rd directory
     for use in package overview help pages, and promptPackage() now
     makes use of them.

   * tools::parse_Rd() gains a new permissive argument which converts
     unrecognized macros into text.  This is used by
     utils:::format.bibentry to allow LaTeX markup to be ignored.

   * options(OutDec =) can now specify a multi-byte character, e.g.,
     options(OutDec = "\u00b7") in a UTF-8 locale.

   * is.recursive(x) is no longer true when x is an external pointer,
     a weak reference or byte code; the first enables all.equal(x, x)
     when x <- getClass(.).

   * ls() (aka objects()) and as.list.environment() gain a new
     argument sorted.

   * The "source" attribute (which has not been added to functions by
     R since before R version 2.14.0) is no longer treated as special.

   * Function returnValue() has been added to give on.exit() code
     access to a function's return value for debugging purposes.

   * crossprod(x, y) allows more matrix coercions when x or y are
     vectors, now equalling t(x) %*% y in these cases (also reported
     by Radford Neal).  Similarly, tcrossprod(x,y) and %*% work in
     more cases with vector arguments.

   * Utility function dynGet() useful for detecting cycles, aka
     infinite recursions.

   * The byte-code compiler and interpreter include new instructions
     that allow many scalar subsetting and assignment and scalar
     arithmetic operations to be handled more efficiently. This can
     result in significant performance improvements in scalar
     numerical code.

   * apply(m, 2, identity) is now the same as the matrix m when it has
     _named_ row names.

   * A new function debuggingState() has been added, allowing to
     temporarily turn off debugging.

   * example() gets a new optional argument run.donttest and
     tools::Rd2ex() a corresponding commentDonttest, with a default
     such that example(..) in help examples will run \donttest code
     only if used interactively (a change in behaviour).

   * rbind.data.frame() gains an optional argument make.row.names, for
     potential speedup.

   * New function extSoftVersion() to report on the versions of
     third-party software in use in this session.  Currently reports
     versions of zlib, bzlib, the liblzma from xz, PCRE, ICU, TRE and
     the iconv implementation.

     A similar function grSoftVersion() in package grDevices reports
     on third-party graphics software.

     Function tcltk::tclVersion() reports the Tcl/Tk version.

   * Calling callGeneric() without arguments now works with primitive
     generics to some extent.

   * vapply(x, FUN, FUN.VALUE) is more efficient notably for large
     length(FUN.VALUE); as extension of PR#16061.

   * as.table() now allows tables with one or more dimensions of
     length 0 (such as as.table(integer())).

   * names(x) <- NULL now clears the names of call and ... objects.

   * library() will report a warning when an insufficient dependency
     version is masking a sufficient one later on the library search
     path.

   * A new plot() method for class "raster" has been added.

   * New check_packages_in_dir_changes() function in package tools for
     conveniently analyzing how changing sources impacts the check
     results of their reverse dependencies.

   * Speed-up from Peter Haverty for ls() and
     methods:::.requirePackage() speeding up package loading.
     (PR#16133)

   * New get0() function, combining exists() and get() in one call,
     for efficiency.

   * match.call() gains an envir argument for specifying the
     environment from which to retrieve the ... in the call, if any;
     this environment was wrong (or at least undesirable) when the
     definition argument was a function.

   * topenv() has been made .Internal() for speedup, based on Peter
     Haverty's proposal in PR#16140.

   * getOption() no longer calls options() in the main case.

   * Optional use of libcurl (version 7.28.0 from Oct 2012 or later)
     for Internet access:

       * capabilities("libcurl") reports if this is available.

       * libcurlVersion() reports the version in use, and other
         details of the "libcurl" build including which URL schemes it
         supports.

       * curlGetHeaders() retrieves the headers for http://, https://,
         ftp:// and ftps:// URLs: analysis of these headers can
         provide insights into the `existence' of a URL (it might for
         example be permanently redirected) and is so used in R CMD
         check --as-cran.

       * download.file() has a new optional method "libcurl" which
         will handle more URL schemes, follow redirections, and allows
         simultaneous downloads of multiple URLs.

       * url() has a new method "libcurl" which handles more URL
         schemes and follows redirections.  The default method is
         controlled by a new option url.method, which applies also to
         the opening of URLs _via_ file() (which happens implicitly in
         functions such as read.table.)

       * When file() or url() is invoked with a https:// or ftps://
         URL which the current method cannot handle, it switches to a
         suitable method if one is available.

   * (Windows.) The DLLs internet.dll and internet2.dll have been
     merged.  In this version it is safe to switch (repeatedly)
     between the internal and Windows internet functions within an R
     session.

     The Windows internet functions are still selected by flag
     --internet2 or setInternet2().  This can be overridden for an
     url() connection _via_ its new method argument.

     download.file() has new method "wininet", selected as the default
     by --internet2 or setInternet2().

   * parent.env<- can no longer modify the parent of a locked
     namespace or namespace imports environment.  Contributed by Karl
     Millar.

   * New function isLoadedNamespace() for readability and speed.

   * names(env) now returns all the object names of an environment
     env, equivalently to ls(env, all.names = TRUE, sorted = FALSE)
     and also to the names of the corresponding list,
     names(as.list(env, all.names = TRUE)).  Note that although
     names() returns a character vector, the names have no particular
     ordering.

   * The memory manager now grows the heap more aggressively. This
     reduces the number of garbage collections, in particular while
     data or code are loaded, at the expense of slightly increasing
     the memory footprint.

   * New function trimws() for removing leading/trailing whitespace.

   * cbind() and rbind() now consider S4 inheritance during S3
     dispatch and also obey deparse.level.

   * cbind() and rbind() will delegate recursively to methods::cbind2
     (methods::rbind2) when at least one argument is an S4 object and
     S3 dispatch fails (due to ambiguity).

   * (Windows.)  download.file(quiet = FALSE) now uses text rather
     than Windows progress bars in non-interactive use.

   * New function hsearch_db() in package utils for building and
     retrieving the help search database used by help.search(), along
     with functions for inspecting the concepts and keywords in the
     help search database.

   * New function .getNamespaceInfo(), a no-check version of
     getNamespaceInfo() mostly for internal speedups.

   * The help search system now takes \keyword entries in Rd files
     which are not standard keywords (as given in KEYWORDS in the R
     documentation directory) as concepts.  For standard keyword
     entries the corresponding descriptions are additionally taken as
     concepts.

   * New lengths() function for getting the lengths of all elements in
     a list.

   * New function toTitleCase() in package tools, tailored to package
     titles.

   * The matrix methods of cbind() and rbind() allow matrices as
     inputs which have 2^31 or more elements.  (For cbind(), wish of
     PR#16198.)

   * The default method of image() has an explicit check for a numeric
     or logical matrix (which was always required).

   * URLencode() will not by default encode further URLs which appear
     to be already encoded.

   * BIC(mod) and BIC(mod, mod2) now give non-NA numbers for arima()
     fitted models, as nobs(mod) now gives the number of "used"
     observations for such models.  This fixes PR#16198, quite
     differently than proposed there.

   * The print() methods for "htest", "pairwise.htest" and
     "power.htest" objects now have a digits argument defaulting to (a
     function of) getOption("digits"), and influencing all printed
     numbers coherently.  Unavoidably, this changes the display of
     such test results in some cases.

   * Code completion for namespaces now recognizes all loaded
     namespaces, rather than only the ones that are also attached.

   * The code completion mechanism can now be replaced by a
     user-specified completer function, for (temporary) situations
     where the usual code completion is inappropriate.

   * unzip() will now warn if it is able to detect truncation when
     unpacking a file of 4GB or more (related to PR#16243).

   * methods() reports S4 in addition to S3 methods; output is
     simplified when the class argument is used.  .S3methods() and
     methods::.S4methods() report S3 and S4 methods separately.

   * Higher order functions such as the apply functions and Reduce()
     now force arguments to the functions they apply in order to
     eliminate undesirable interactions between lazy evaluation and
     variable capture in closures.  This resolves PR#16093.

 INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

   * The \donttest sections of R's help files can be tested by
     make check TEST_DONTTEST=TRUE .

   * It is possible to request the use of system valgrind headers
     _via_ configure option --with-system-valgrind-headers: note the
     possible future incompatibility of such headers discussed in the
     'R Installation and Administration' manual. (Wish of PR#16068.)

   * The included version of liblzma has been updated to xz-utils
     5.0.7 (minor bug fixes from 5.0.5).

   * configure options --with-system-zlib, --with-system-bzlib and
     --with-system-pcre are now the default.  For the time being there
     is fallback to the versions included in the R sources if no
     system versions are found or (unlikely) if they are too old.

     Linux users should check that the -devel or -dev versions of
     packages zlib, bzip2/libbz2 and pcre as well as
     xz-devel/liblzma-dev (or similar names) are installed.

   * configure by default looks for the texi2any script from texinfo
     5.1 or later, rather than the makeinfo program.  (makeinfo is a
     link to the Perl script texi2any in texinfo 5.x.)

   * R CMD INSTALL gains an option --built-timestamp=STAMP allowing
     100% reproducible package building, thanks to Dirk Eddelbuettel.

 UTILITIES:

   * There is support for testing the \dontrun and \donttest parts of
     examples in packages.

     tools::testInstalledPackage() accepts new arguments
     commentDontrun = FALSE and commentDonttest = FALSE.

     R CMD check gains options --run-dontrun and --run-donttest.

   * The HTML generated by tools::Rd2HTML() and tools::toHTML()
     methods is now 'XHTML 1.0 Strict'.

   * The compiler package's utility function setCompilerOptions() now
     returns the old values invisibly. The initial optimization level
     can also be set with the environment variable
     R_COMPILER_OPTIMIZE.

   * R CMD build adds a NeedsCompilation field if one is not already
     present in the DESCRIPTION file.

   * R CMD check gains option --test-dir to specify an alternative set
     of tests to run.

   * R CMD check will now by default continue with testing after many
     types of errors, and will output a summary count of errors at the
     end if any have occurred.

   * R CMD check now checks that the Title and Description fields are
     correctly terminated.

   * R CMD check --as-cran now:

       * checks a README.md file can be processed: this needs pandoc
         installed.

       * checks the existence and accessibility of URLs in the
         DESCRIPTION, CITATION, NEWS.Rd and README.md files and in the
         help files (provided the build has libcurl support).

       * reports non-ASCII characters in R source files when there is
         no package encoding declared in the DESCRIPTION file.

       * reports (apparent) S3 methods exported but not registered.

       * reports overwriting registered S3 methods from
         base/recommended packages.  (Such methods are replaced in the
         affected package for the rest of the session, even if the
         replacing namespace is unloaded.)

       * reports if the Title field does not appear to be in title
         case (see 'Writing R Extensions': there may be false
         positives, but note that technical words should be
         single-quoted and will then be accepted).

     Most of these checks can also be selected by environment
     variables: see the 'R Internals' manual.

 C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

   * New C API utility logspace_sum(logx[], n).

   * Entry points rbinom_mu, rnbinom_mu and rmultinom are remapped (by
     default) to Rf_rbinom_mu etc.  This requires packages using them
     to be re-installed.

   * .C(DUP = FALSE) and .Fortran(DUP = FALSE) are now ignored, so
     arguments are duplicated if DUP = TRUE would do so.  As their
     help has long said, .Call() is much preferred.

   * New entry point R_allocLD, like R_alloc but guaranteed to have
     sufficient alignment for long double pointers.

   * isPairList() now returns TRUE for DOTSXP.

 WINDOWS BUILD CHANGES:

 A number of changes to the Windows build system are in development.
 The following are currently in place.

   * Installation using external binary distributions of zlib, bzip2,
     liblzma, pcre, libpng, jpeglib and libtiff is now required, and
     the build instructions have been revised.

   * A new make target rsync-extsoft has been added to obtain copies
     of the external libraries from CRAN.

   * Building the manuals now requires texi2any from texinfo 5.1 or
     later.  CRAN binary builds include the manuals, but by default
     builds from source will not, and they will be accessed from CRAN.
     See the comments in src/gnuwin32/MkRules.dist for how to specify
     the location of texi2any.

   * (Windows) Changes have been made to support an experimental
     Windows toolchain based on GCC 4.9.2.  The default toolchain
     continues to be based on GCC 4.6.3, as the new toolchain is not
     yet stable enough.  A change to a new toolchain is expected
     during the R 3.2.x lifetime.

 PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

   * (Windows) The use of macro ZLIB_LIBS in file src/Makevars.win
     (which has not been documented for a long time) now requires an
     external libz.a to be available (it is part of the 'goodies' used
     to compile Windows binary packages).  It would be simpler to use
     -lz instead.

   * The default for option pkgType on platforms using binary packages
     is now "both", so source packages will be tried if binary
     versions are not available or not up to date.

     There are options for what install.packages(type = "both")
     (possibly called _via_ update.packages()) will do if compilation
     of a source package is desirable: see ?options (under utils).

     If you intend not to accept updates as source packages, you
     should use update.packages(type = "binary").

 DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

   * download.file(method = "lynx") is defunct.

   * Building R using the included versions of zlib, bzip2, xz and
     PCRE is deprecated: these are frozen (bar essential bug-fixes)
     and will be removed for R 3.3.0.

   * The configure option --with-valgrind-instrumentation=3 has been
     withdrawn, as it did not work with recent valgrind headers: it is
     now treated as level 2.

   * The MethodsList class in package methods had been deprecated in R
     2.11.0 and is defunct now.  Functions using it are defunct if
     they had been deprecated in R 2.11.0, and are deprecated now,
     otherwise.

 BUG FIXES:

   * Fixed two obscure bugs in pairlist subassignment, reported by
     Radford Neal as part of pqR issue 16.

   * Fixes for bugs in handling empty arguments and argument matching
     by name in log().

   * all.equal() gains methods for environments and refClasses.

   * [<- and [[<- gain S4 data.frame methods to avoid corruption of S4
     class information by the S3 methods.

   * callNextMethod() should now work within a .local call when ... is
     absent from formals(.local).

   * dput(pairlist(x)) generates a call to the pairlist constructor
     instead of the list constructor.

   * Fix missing() when arguments are propagated through ... .
     (PR#15707)

   * eigen(m) now defaults to symmetric = TRUE even when the dimnames
     are asymmetric if the matrix is otherwise symmetric.  (PR#16151)

   * Fix issues with forwarding ... through callGeneric() and
     callNextMethod().  (PR#16141)

   * callGeneric() now works after a callNextMethod().

   * Subclass information is kept consistent when replacing an
     ordinary S4 class with an "old class" _via_ the S4Class argument
     to setOldClass(). Thus, for example, a data.frame is valid for a
     list argument in the signature, and a factor is valid for vector
     arguments.

   * In qbeta() the inversion of pbeta() is much more sophisticated.
     This works better in corner cases some of which failed completely
     previously (PR#15755), or were using too many iterations.

   * Auto-printing no longer duplicates objects when printing is
     dispatched to a method.

   * kmeans(x, k) would fail when nrow(x) >= 42949673.  (Comment 6 of
     PR#15364)

   * 'Abbreviated' locale-specific day and month names could have been
     truncated in those rare locales where there are the same as the
     full names.

   * An irrelevant warning message from updating subclass information
     was silenced (the namespace would not be writable in this case).

Subject: The R Foundation announces new mailing list 'R-package-devel'
Message-ID: <21853.40698.326587.61371@stat.math.ethz.ch>

New Mailing list:  R-package-devel -- User R Packages Development

At last week's monthly meeting, the R foundation has decided to
create a new mailing list in order to help R package authors in
their package development and testing.

The idea is that some experienced R programmers (often those
currently helping on R-devel or also R-help) will help package
authors and thus unload some of the burden of the CRAN team
members.

Please read the detailed description of the mailing list here,
       https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-package-devel
or also the more extended announcement of the list on R-devel,
archived at

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

CHANGES IN R 3.2.1:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * utf8ToInt() now checks that its input is valid UTF-8 and returns
      NA if it is not.

    * install.packages() now allows type = "both" with repos = NULL if
      it can infer the type of file.

    * nchar(x, *) and nzchar(x) gain a new argument keepNA which
      governs how the result for NAs in x is determined.  For the R
      3.2.x series, the default remains FALSE which is fully back
      compatible.  From R 3.3.0, the default will change to keepNA = NA
      and you are advised to consider this for code portability.

    * news() more flexibly extracts dates from package NEWS.Rd files.

    * lengths(x) now also works (trivially) for atomic x and hence can
      be used more generally as an efficient replacement of sapply(x,
      length) and similar.

    * The included version of PCRE has been updated to 8.37, a bug-fix
      release.

    * diag() no longer duplicates a matrix when extracting its
      diagonal.

    * as.character.srcref() gains an argument to allow characters
      corresponding to a range of source references to be extracted.

  BUG FIXES:

    * acf() and ccf() now guarantee values strictly in [-1,1] (instead
      of sometimes very slightly outside). PR#15832.

    * as.integer("111111111111") now gives NA (with a warning) as it
      does for the corresponding numeric or negative number coercions.
      Further, as.integer(M + 0.1) now gives M (instead of NA) when M
      is the maximal representable integer.

    * On some platforms nchar(x, "c") and nchar(x, "w") would return
      values (possibly NA) for inputs which were declared to be UTF-8
      but were not, or for invalid strings without a marked encoding in
      a multi-byte locale, rather than give an error.  Additional
      checks have been added to mitigate this.

    * apply(a, M, function(u) c(X = ., Y = .)) again has dimnames
      containing "X" and "Y" (as in R < 3.2.0).

    * (Windows only) In some cases, the --clean option to R CMD INSTALL
      could fail.  (PR#16178)

    * (Windows only) choose.files() would occasionally include
      characters from the result of an earlier call in the result of a
      later one.  (PR#16270)

    * A change in RSiteSearch() in R 3.2.0 caused it to submit invalid
      URLs.  (PR#16329)

    * Rscript and command line R silently ignored incomplete statements
      at the end of a script; now they are reported as parse errors.
      (PR#16350)

    * Parse data for very long strings was not stored.  (PR#16354)

    * plotNode(), the workhorse of the plot method for "dendrogram"s is
      no longer recursive, thanks to Suharto Anggono, and hence also
      works for deeply nested dendrograms.  (PR#15215)

    * The parser could overflow internally when given numbers in
      scientific format with extremely large exponents.  (PR#16358)

    * If the CRAN mirror was not set, install.packages(type = "both")
      and related functions could repeatedly query the user for it.
      (Part of PR#16362)

    * The low-level functions .rowSums() etc. did not check the length
      of their argument, so could segfault. (PR#16367)

    * The quietly argument of library() is now correctly propagated
      from .getRequiredPackages2().

    * Under some circumstances using the internal PCRE when building R
      fron source would cause external libs such as -llzma to be
      omitted from the main link.

    * The .Primitive default methods of the logic operators, i.e., !, &
      and |, now give correct error messages when appropriate, e.g.,
      for `&`(TRUE) or `!`().  (PR#16385)

    * cummax(x) now correctly propagates NAs also when x is of type
      integer and begins with an NA.

    * summaryRprof() could fail when the profile contained only two
      records.  (PR#16395)

    * HTML vignettes opened using vignette() did not support links into
      the rest of the HTML help system.  (Links worked properly when
      the vignette was opened using browseVignettes() or from within
      the help system.)

    * arima(*, xreg = .) (for d >= 1) computes estimated variances
      based on a the number of effective observations as in R version
      3.0.1 and earlier.  (PR#16278)

    * slotNames(.) is now correct for "signature" objects (mostly used
      internally in methods).

    * On some systems, the first string comparison after a locale
      change would result in NA.

The build system rolled up  R-3.2.2.tar.gz (codename "Fire Safety") this morning.

The list below details the changes in this release. The main point of this release is to enable package installation via secure HTTP, since ordinary HTTP is increasingly being considered a security risk.

CHANGES IN R 3.2.2:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * It is now easier to use secure downloads from https:// URLs on
      builds which support them: no longer do non-default options need
      to be selected to do so.  In particular, packages can be
      installed from repositories which offer https:// URLs, and those
      listed by setRepositories() now do so (for some of their
      mirrors).

      Support for https:// URLs is available on Windows, and on other
      platforms if support for libcurl was compiled in and if that
      supports the https protocol (system installations can be expected
      to do).  So https:// support can be expected except on rather old
      OSes (an example being OS X 'Snow Leopard', where a non-system
      version of libcurl can be used).

      (Windows only) The default method for accessing URLs _via_
      download.file() and url() has been changed to be "wininet" using
      Windows API calls.  This changes the way proxies need to be set
      and security settings made: there have been some reports of sites
      being inaccessible under the new default method (but the previous
      methods remain available).

  NEW FEATURES:

    * cmdscale() gets new option list. for increased flexibility when a
      list should be returned.

    * configure now supports texinfo version 6.0, which (unlike the
      change from 4.x to 5.0) is a minor update.  (Wish of PR#16456.)

    * (Non-Windows only) download.file() with default method = "auto"
      now chooses "libcurl" if that is available and a https:// or
      ftps:// URL is used.

    * (Windows only) setInternet2(TRUE) is now the default.  The
      command-line option --internet2 and environment variable
      R_WIN_INTERNET2 are now ignored.

      Thus by default the "internal" method for download.file() and
      url() uses the "wininet" method: to revert to the previous
      default use setInternet2(FALSE).

      This means that https:// can be read by default by
      download.file() (they have been readable by file() and url()
      since R 3.2.0).

      There are implications for how proxies need to be set (see
      ?download.file): also, cacheOK = FALSE is not supported.

    * chooseCRANmirror() and chooseBioCmirror() now offer HTTPS mirrors
      in preference to HTTP mirrors.  This changes the interpretation
      of their ind arguments: see their help pages.

    * capture.output() gets optional arguments type and split to pass
      to sink(), and hence can be used to capture messages.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * Header Rconfig.h now defines HAVE_ALLOCA_H if the platform has
      the alloca.h header (it is needed to define alloca on Solaris and
      AIX, at least: see 'Writing R Extensions' for how to use it).

  INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

    * The libtool script generated by configure has been modified to
      support FreeBSD >= 10 (PR#16410).

  BUG FIXES:

    * The HTML help page links to demo code failed due to a change in R
      3.2.0.  (PR#16432)

    * If the na.action argument was used in model.frame(), the original
      data could be modified. (PR#16436)

    * getGraphicsEvent() could cause a crash if a graphics window was
      closed while it was in use. (PR#16438)

    * matrix(x, nr, nc, byrow = TRUE) failed if x was an object of type
      "expression".

    * strptime() could overflow the allocated storage on the C stack
      when the timezone had a non-standard format much longer than the
      standard formats. (Part of PR#16328.)

    * options(OutDec = s) now signals a warning (which will become an
      error in the future) when s is not a string with exactly one
      character, as that has been a documented requirement.

    * prettyNum() gains a new option input.d.mark which together with
      other changes, e.g., the default for decimal.mark, fixes some
      format()ting variants with non-default getOption("OutDec") such
      as in PR#16411.

    * download.packages() failed for type equal to either "both" or
      "binary".  (Reported by Dan Tenenbaum.)

    * The dendrogram method of labels() is much more efficient for
      large dendrograms, now using rapply().  (Comment #15 of PR#15215)

    * The "port" algorithm of nls() could give spurious errors.
      (Reported by Radford Neal.)

    * Reference classes that inherited from reference classes in
      another package could invalidate methods of the inherited class.
      Fixing this requires adding the ability for methods to be
      "external", with the object supplied explicitly as the first
      argument, named .self. See "Inter-Package Superclasses" in the
      documentation.

    * readBin() could fail on the SPARC architecture due to alignment
      issues.  (Reported by Radford Neal.)

    * qt(*, df=Inf, ncp=.) now uses the natural qnorm() limit instead
      of returning NaN. (PR#16475)

    * Auto-printing of S3 and S4 values now searches for print() in the
      base namespace and show() in the methods namespace instead of
      searching the global environment.

    * polym() gains a coefs = NULL argument and returns class "poly"
      just like poly() which gets a new simple=FALSE option.  They now
      lead to correct predict()ions, e.g., on subsets of the original
      data.

    * rhyper(nn, <large>) now works correctly. (PR#16489)

    * ttkimage() did not (and could not) work so was removed. Ditto for
      tkimage.cget() and tkimage.configure(). Added two Ttk widgets and
      missing subcommands for Tk's image command: ttkscale(),
      ttkspinbox(), tkimage.delete(), tkimage.height(),
      tkimage.inuse(), tkimage.type(), tkimage.types(),
      tkimage.width(). (PR#15372, PR#16450)

    * getClass("foo") now also returns a class definition when it is
      found in the cache more than once.

Subject: Codes of Conduct at R Conferences
Message-ID: <1445519194.6634.174.camel@r-project.org>

The useR! conferences in 2014 and 2015 both had codes of conduct in
order to ensure an experience free from harassment for all participants.
After a request from some members of the R community, the R Foundation
has decided to endorse this practice. Future conferences supported by
the R Foundation must have a code of conduct.  We encourage other R
meetings not affiliated with the R Foundation to adopt the same policy.

A code of conduct serves two important purposes. Firstly, it sends a
clear message to those outside the community that an R conference is a
professional and comfortable working environment for all participants.
Secondly, it provides a mechanism for reporting and monitoring any
incidents of harassment that may occur.

We have decided not to require a particular formulation for the code of
conduct, but suggest that conference organizers use the model of the
useR! 2015 meeting ( http://user2015.math.aau.dk/behaviouR ). This will
allow the code to be adapted to local circumstances and to evolve in the
future. Conference organizers should ensure that any sanctions laid out
in the code of conduct are legally and practically enforceable. 

Vigorous debate and lively exchange are important features of R
conferences. We expect this to continue within the boundaries set by the
code of conduct.

For the R Foundation
Martyn Plummer, Co-President

CHANGES IN R 3.2.3:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Some recently-added Windows time zone names have been added to
      the conversion table used to convert these to Olson names.
      (Including those relating to changes for Russia in Oct 2014, as
      in PR#16503.)

    * (Windows) Compatibility information has been added to the
      manifests for Rgui.exe, Rterm.exe and Rscript.exe.  This should
      allow win.version() and Sys.info() to report the actual Windows
      version up to Windows 10.

    * Windows "wininet" FTP first tries EPSV / PASV mode rather than
      only using active mode (reported by Dan Tenenbaum).

    * which.min(x) and which.max(x) may be much faster for logical and
      integer x and now also work for long vectors.

    * The 'emulation' part of tools::texi2dvi() has been somewhat
      enhanced, including supporting quiet = TRUE.  It can be selected
      by texi2dvi = "emulation".

      (Windows) MiKTeX removed its texi2dvi.exe command in Sept 2015:
      tools::texi2dvi() tries texify.exe if it is not found.

    * (Windows only) Shortcuts for printing and saving have been added
      to menus in Rgui.exe.  (Request of PR#16572.)

    * loess(..., iterTrace=TRUE) now provides diagnostics for
      robustness iterations, and the print() method for
      summary(<loess>) shows slightly more.

    * The included version of PCRE has been updated to 8.38, a bug-fix
      release.

    * View() now displays nested data frames in a more friendly way.
      (Request with patch in PR#15915.)

  INSTALLATION and INCLUDED SOFTWARE:

    * The included configuration code for libintl has been updated to
      that from gettext version 0.19.5.1 - this should only affect how
      an external library is detected (and the only known instance is
      under OpenBSD).  (Wish of PR#16464.)

    * configure has a new argument --disable-java to disable the checks
      for Java.

    * The configure default for MAIN_LDFLAGS has been changed for the
      FreeBSD, NetBSD and Hurd OSes to one more likely to work with
      compilers other than gcc (FreeBSD 10 defaults to clang).

    * configure now supports the OpenMP flags -fopenmp=libomp (clang)
      and -qopenmp (Intel C).

    * Various macros can be set to override the default behaviour of
      configure when detecting OpenMP: see file config.site.

    * Source installation on Windows has been modified to allow for
      MiKTeX installations without texi2dvi.exe.  See file
      MkRules.dist.

  BUG FIXES:

    * regexpr(pat, x, perl = TRUE) with Python-style named capture did
      not work correctly when x contained NA strings.  (PR#16484)

    * The description of dataset ToothGrowth has been
      improved/corrected.  (PR#15953)

    * model.tables(type = "means") and hence TukeyHSD() now support
      "aov" fits without an intercept term.  (PR#16437)

    * close() now reports the status of a pipe() connection opened with
      an explicit open argument.  (PR#16481)

    * Coercing a list without names to a data frame is faster if the
      elements are very long. (PR#16467)

    * (Unix-only) Under some rare circumstances piping the output from
      Rscript or R -f could result in attempting to close the input
      file twice, possibly crashing the process.  (PR#16500)

    * (Windows) Sys.info() was out of step with win.version() and did
      not report Windows 8.

    * topenv(baseenv()) returns baseenv() again as in R 3.1.0 and
      earlier.  This also fixes compilerJIT(3) when used in .Rprofile.

    * detach()ing the methods package keeps .isMethodsDispatchOn()
      true, as long as the methods namespace is not unloaded.

    * Removed some spurious warnings from configure about the
      preprocessor not finding header files.  (PR#15989)

    * rchisq(*, df=0, ncp=0) now returns 0 instead of NaN, and
      dchisq(*, df=0, ncp=*) also no longer returns NaN in limit cases
      (where the limit is unique).  (PR#16521)

    * pchisq(*, df=0, ncp > 0, log.p=TRUE) no longer underflows (for
      ncp > ~60).

    * nchar(x, "w") returned -1 for characters it did not know about
      (e.g. zero-width spaces): it now assumes 1.  It now knows about
      most zero-width characters and a few more double-width
      characters.

    * Help for which.min() is now more precise about behavior with
      logical arguments.  (PR#16532)

    * The print width of character strings marked as "latin1" or
      "bytes" was in some cases computed incorrectly.

    * abbreviate() did not give names to the return value if minlength
      was zero, unlike when it was positive.

    * (Windows only) dir.create() did not always warn when it failed to
      create a directory.  (PR#16537)

    * When operating in a non-UTF-8 multibyte locale (e.g. an East
      Asian locale on Windows), grep() and related functions did not
      handle UTF-8 strings properly.  (PR#16264)

    * read.dcf() sometimes misread lines longer than 8191 characters.
      (Reported by Herv'e Pag`es with a patch.)

    * within(df, ..) no longer drops columns whose name start with a
      ".".

    * The built-in HTTP server converted entire Content-Type to
      lowercase including parameters which can cause issues for
      multi-part form boundaries (PR#16541).

    * Modifying slots of S4 objects could fail when the methods package
      was not attached. (PR#16545)

    * splineDesign(*, outer.ok=TRUE) (splines) is better now
      (PR#16549), and interpSpline() now allows sparse=TRUE for speedup
      with non-small sizes.

    * If the expression in the traceback was too long, traceback() did
      not report the source line number.  (Patch by Kirill M"uller.)

    * The browser did not truncate the display of the function when
      exiting with options("deparse.max.lines") set.  (PR#16581)

    * When bs(*, Boundary.knots=) had boundary knots inside the data
      range, extrapolation was somewhat off.  (Patch by Trevor Hastie.)

    * var() and hence sd() warn about factor arguments which are
      deprecated now. (PR#16564)

    * loess(*, weights = *) stored wrong weights and hence gave
      slightly wrong predictions for newdata.  (PR#16587)

    * aperm(a, *) now preserves names(dim(a)).

    * poly(x, ..) now works when either raw=TRUE or coef is specified.
      (PR#16597)

    * data(package=*) is more careful in determining the path.

    * prettyNum(*, decimal.mark, big.mark): fixed bug introduced when
      fixing PR#16411.
