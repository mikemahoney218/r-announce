CHANGES IN R 4.2.3:

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The definition of DL_FUNC in R_ext/Rdynload.h has been changed to
      be fully C-compliant.  This means that functions loaded _via_ for
      example R_GetCCallable need to be cast to an appropriate type if
      they have any arguments.

    * .Machine has a new element sizeof.time_t to identify old systems
      with a 32-bit type and hence a limited range of date-times (and
      limited support for dates millions of years from present).

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * (Windows) The default C++ standard had accidentally been left at
      C++11 when it was changed to C++14 on Unix.

  BUG FIXES:

    * As "POSIXlt" objects may be "partially filled" and their list
      components meant to be recycled, length() now is the length of
      the longest component.

    * as.POSIXlt.Date() could underflow for dates in the far past (more
      than half a million years BCE).

    * as.Date.POSIXlt(x) would return "1970-01-01" instead of NA in R
      4.2.2, e.g., for

              x <- as.POSIXlt(c("2019-01-30","2001-1-1"))
              x$mon <- c(0L, NA); as.Date(x)
      
    * R CMD check failed to apply enabled _R_CHECK_SUGGESTS_ONLY_ to
      examples and vignettes (regression in R 4.2.0).

    * R CMD check did not re-build vignettes in separate processes by
      default (regression in R 4.2.0).

    * Running examples from HTML documentation now restores previous
      knitr settings and options (PR#18420).

    * Quartz: fonts are now located using Core Graphics API instead of
      deprecated ATS which is no longer supported in the macOS 13 SDK
      (PR#18426).  This also addresses an issue where the currently
      used font in the Quartz device context was not correctly
      retained.

    * (Windows) Math symbols in text drawing functions are again
      rendered correctly (PR#18440).  This fixes a regression in R
      4.2.1 caused by a fix in PR#18382 which uncovered an issue in
      GraphApp due to which the symbol charset was not used with TT
      Symbol font face.

    * (Windows) Installing a package with a src/Makefile.{win,ucrt}
      file includes ~/.R/Makevars.win64 in the search for user
      makevars, as documented in "R Installation and Administration"
      and done for packages with a src/Makevars.{win,ucrt} file.

    * format(<POSIXlt_w/_unbalanced_sec>, "....%OS<n>") with n > 0 no
      longer accidentally uses the unbalanced seconds, thanks to
      Suharto Anggono's report (including patch) in PR#18448.

    * solve.default(a, b) works around issues with some versions of
      LAPACK when a contains NA or NaN values.

    * When UseMethod() cannot dispatch, it no longer segfaults
      producing the error message in case of a long class(), thanks to
      Joris Vankerschaver's report (including patch) in PR#18447.

    * When example(foo, ..) produces graphics on an interactive device
      it needs to open itself, it now leaves devAskNewPage() unchanged
      even when it was FALSE, thus fixing a 14 years old '<FIXME>'.

    * packageDescription() again catches errors from encoding
      conversions. This also fixes broken packageVersion() in C locale
      on systems where iconv does not support transliteration.
