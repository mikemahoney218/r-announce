CHANGES IN R 4.2.3:

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The definition of DL_FUNC in R_ext/Rdynload.h has been changed to
      be fully C-compliant.  This means that functions loaded _via_ for
      example R_GetCCallable need to be cast to an appropriate type if
      they have any arguments.

    * .Machine has a new element sizeof.time_t to identify old systems
      with a 32-bit type and hence a limited range of date-times (and
      limited support for dates millions of years from present).

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * (Windows) The default C++ standard had accidentally been left at
      C++11 when it was changed to C++14 on Unix.

  BUG FIXES:

    * As "POSIXlt" objects may be "partially filled" and their list
      components meant to be recycled, length() now is the length of
      the longest component.

    * as.POSIXlt.Date() could underflow for dates in the far past (more
      than half a million years BCE).

    * as.Date.POSIXlt(x) would return "1970-01-01" instead of NA in R
      4.2.2, e.g., for

              x <- as.POSIXlt(c("2019-01-30","2001-1-1"))
              x$mon <- c(0L, NA); as.Date(x)
      
    * R CMD check failed to apply enabled _R_CHECK_SUGGESTS_ONLY_ to
      examples and vignettes (regression in R 4.2.0).

    * R CMD check did not re-build vignettes in separate processes by
      default (regression in R 4.2.0).

    * Running examples from HTML documentation now restores previous
      knitr settings and options (PR#18420).

    * Quartz: fonts are now located using Core Graphics API instead of
      deprecated ATS which is no longer supported in the macOS 13 SDK
      (PR#18426).  This also addresses an issue where the currently
      used font in the Quartz device context was not correctly
      retained.

    * (Windows) Math symbols in text drawing functions are again
      rendered correctly (PR#18440).  This fixes a regression in R
      4.2.1 caused by a fix in PR#18382 which uncovered an issue in
      GraphApp due to which the symbol charset was not used with TT
      Symbol font face.

    * (Windows) Installing a package with a src/Makefile.{win,ucrt}
      file includes ~/.R/Makevars.win64 in the search for user
      makevars, as documented in "R Installation and Administration"
      and done for packages with a src/Makevars.{win,ucrt} file.

    * format(<POSIXlt_w/_unbalanced_sec>, "....%OS<n>") with n > 0 no
      longer accidentally uses the unbalanced seconds, thanks to
      Suharto Anggono's report (including patch) in PR#18448.

    * solve.default(a, b) works around issues with some versions of
      LAPACK when a contains NA or NaN values.

    * When UseMethod() cannot dispatch, it no longer segfaults
      producing the error message in case of a long class(), thanks to
      Joris Vankerschaver's report (including patch) in PR#18447.

    * When example(foo, ..) produces graphics on an interactive device
      it needs to open itself, it now leaves devAskNewPage() unchanged
      even when it was FALSE, thus fixing a 14 years old '<FIXME>'.

    * packageDescription() again catches errors from encoding
      conversions. This also fixes broken packageVersion() in C locale
      on systems where iconv does not support transliteration.

CHANGES IN R 4.3.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * Calling && or || with LHS or (if evaluated) RHS of length greater
      than one is now always an error, with a report of the form

          'length = 4' in coercion to 'logical(1)'
      
      Environment variable _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_ no longer has any
      effect.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The included BLAS sources have been updated to those shipped with
      LAPACK version 3.10.1.  (This caused some platform-dependent
      changes to package check output.)  And then to the sources from
      LAPACK version 3.11.0 (with changes only to double complex
      subroutines).

    * The included LAPACK sources have been updated to include the four
      Fortran 90 routines rather than their Fortran 77 predecessors.
      This may give some different signs in SVDs or
      eigendecompositions..  (This completes the transition to LAPACK
      3.10.x begun in R 4.2.0.)

    * The LAPACK sources have been updated to version 3.11.0.  (No new
      subroutines have been added, so this almost entirely bug fixes:
      Those fixes do affect some computations with NaNs, including R's
      NA.)

    * The parser now signals _classed_ errors, notably in case of the
      pipe operator |>.  The error object and message now give line and
      column numbers, mostly as proposed and provided by Duncan Murdoch
      in PR#18328.

    * toeplitz() is now generalized for asymmetric cases, with a
      toeplitz2() variant.

    * xy.coords() and xyz.coords() and consequently, e.g., plot(x,y,
      log = "y") now signal a _classed_ warning about negative values
      of y (where log(.) is NA).  Such a warning can be specifically
      suppressed or caught otherwise.

    * Regular expression functions now check more thoroughly whether
      their inputs are valid strings (in their encoding, e.g. in
      UTF-8).

    * The performance of grep(), sub(), gsub() and strsplit() has been
      improved, particularly with perl = TRUE and fixed = TRUE.  Use of
      useBytes = TRUE for performance reasons should no longer be
      needed and is discouraged: it may lead to incorrect results.

    * apropos() gains an argument dot_internals which is used by the
      completion (help(rcompgen)) engine to also see base internals
      such as .POSIXct().

    * Support in tools::Rdiff() for comparing uncompressed PDF files is
      further reduced - see its help page.

    * qqplot(x, y, ...) gains conf.level and conf.args arguments for
      computing and plotting a confidence band for the treatment
      function transforming the distribution of x into the distribution
      of y (Switzer, 1976, _Biometrika_). Contributed by Torsten
      Hothorn.

    * Performance of package_dependencies() has been improved for cases
      when the number of dependencies is large.

    * Strings newly created by gsub(), sub() and strsplit(), when any
      of the inputs is marked as "bytes", are also marked as "bytes".
      This reduces the risk of creating invalid strings and accidental
      substitution of bytes deemed invalid.

    * Support for readLines(encoding = "bytes") has been added to allow
      processing special text files byte-by-byte, without creating
      invalid strings.

    * iconv(from = "") now takes into account any declared encoding of
      the input elements and uses it in preference to the native
      encoding.  This reduces the risk of accidental creation of
      invalid strings, particularly when different elements of the
      input have different encoding (including "bytes").

    * Package repositories in getOption("repos") are now initialized
      from the repositories file when utils is loaded (if not already
      set, e.g., in .Rprofile).  (From a report and patch proposal by
      Gabriel Becker in PR#18405.)

    * compactPDF() gets a verbose option.

    * type.convert() and hence read.table() get new option tryLogical =
      TRUE with back compatible default.  When set to false, converts
      "F" or "T" columns to character.

    * Added new unit prefixes "R" and "Q" for abbreviating
      (unrealistically large) sizes beyond 10^{27} in standard = "SI",
      thanks to Henrik Bengtsson's PR#18435.

    * as.data.frame()'s default method now also works fine with atomic
      objects inheriting from classes such as "roman", "octmode" and
      "hexmode", such fulfilling the wish of PR#18421, by Benjamin
      Feakins.

    * The as.data.frame.vector() utility now errors for wrong-length
      row.names.  It warned for almost six years, with "Will be an
      error!".

    * sessionInfo() now also contains La_version() and reports codepage
      and timezone when relevant, in both print() and toLatex() methods
      which also get new option tzone for displaying timezone
      information when locale = FALSE.

    * New function R_compiled_by() reports the C and Fortran compilers
      used to build R, if known.

    * predict(<lm>, newdata = *) no longer unnecessarily creates an
      offset of all 0s.

    * solve() for complex inputs now uses argument tol and by default
      checks for 'computational singularity' (as it long has done for
      numeric inputs).

    * predict(<rank-deficient lm>, newdata=*) now obeys a new argument
      rankdeficient, with new default "warnif", warning only if there
      are non-estimable cases in newdata.  Other options include
      rankdeficient = "NA", predicting NA for non-estimable newdata
      cases.  This addresses PR#15072 by Russ Lenth and is based on his
      original proposal and discussions in PR#16158 also by David Firth
      and Elin Waring.  Still somewhat experimental.

    * Rgui console implementation now works better with the NVDA screen
      reader when the full blinking cursor is selected.  The underlying
      improvements in cursor handling may help also other screen
      readers on Windows.

    * The drop-field control in GraphApp can now be left with the TAB
      key and all controls can be navigated in the reverse order using
      the Shift+TAB key, improving accessibility of the Rgui
      configuration editor.

    * qnorm(<very large negative>, log.p=TRUE) is now fully accurate
      (instead of to "only" minimally five digits).

    * demo(error.catching) now also shows off withWarnings() and
      tryCatchWEMs().

    * As an experimental feature the placeholder _ can now also be used
      in the rhs of a forward pipe |> expression as the first argument
      in an extraction call, such as _$coef. More generally, it can be
      used as the head of a chain of extractions, such as _$coef[[2]].

    * Spaces in the environment variable used to choose the R session's
      temporary directory (TMPDIR, TMP and TEMP are tried in turn) are
      now fatal.  (On Windows the 'short path' version of the path is
      tried and used if that does not contain a space.)

    * all.equal.numeric() gets a new optional switch giveErr to return
      the numeric error as attribute.  Relatedly,
      stopifnot(all.equal<some>(a, b, ..)) is as "smart" now, as
      stopifnot(all.equal(....)) has been already, thus allowing
      customized all.equal<Some>() wrappers.

    * R on Windows is now able to work with path names longer than 260
      characters when these are enabled in the system (requires at
      least Windows 10 version 1607).  Packages should be updated to
      work with long paths as well, instead of assuming PATH_MAX to be
      the maximum length.  Custom front-ends and applications embedding
      R need to update their manifests if they wish to allow this
      feature.  See
      <https://blog.r-project.org/2023/03/07/path-length-limit-on-windows>
      for more information.

    * 'Object not found' and 'Missing argument' errors now give a more
      accurate error context. Patch provided by Lionel Henry in
      PR#18241.

    * The @ operator is now an S3 generic. Based on contributions by
      Tomasz Kalinowski in PR#18482.

    * New generic chooseOpsMethod() provides a mechanism for objects to
      resolve cases where two suitable methods are found for an Ops
      Group Generic. This supports experimenting with alternative
      object systems. Based on contributions by Tomasz Kalinowski in
      PR#18484.

    * inherits(x, what) now accepts values other than a simple
      character vector for argument what. A new generic, nameOfClass(),
      is called to resolve the class name from what. This supports
      experimenting with alternative object systems. Based on
      contributions by Tomasz Kalinowski in PR#18485.

    * Detection of BLAS/LAPACK in use (sessionInfo()) with FlexiBLAS
      now reports the current backend.

    * The "data.frame" method for subset() now warns about extraneous
      arguments, typically catching the use of = instead of == in the
      subset expression.

    * Calling a:b when numeric a or b is longer than one may now be
      made into an error by setting environment variable
      _R_CHECK_LENGTH_COLON_ to a true value, along the proposal in
      PR#18419 by Henrik Bengtsson.

    * density(x, weights = *) now warns if automatic bandwidth
      selection happens without using weights; new optional warnWbw may
      suppress the warning.  Prompted by Christoph Dalitz' PR#18490 and
      its discussants.

    * rm(list = *) is faster and more readable thanks to Kevin Ushey's
      PR#18492.

    * The plot.lm() function no longer produces a normal Q-Q plot for
      GLMs. Instead it plots a half-normal Q-Q plot of the absolute
      value of the standardized deviance residuals.

    * The print() method for class "summary.glm" no longer shows
      summary statistics for the deviance residuals by default.  Its
      optional argument show.residuals can be used to show them if
      required.

    * The tapply() function now accepts a data frame as its X argument,
      and allows INDEX to be a formula in that case. by.data.frame()
      similarly allows INDICES to be a formula.

    * The performance of df[j] <- value (including for missing j) and
      write.table(df) has been improved for data frames df with a large
      number of columns.  (Thanks to Gabriel Becker's PR#18500,
      PR#18503 and discussants, prompted by a report from Toby Dylan
      Hocking on the R-devel mailing list.)

    * The matrix multiply operator %*% is now an S3 generic, belonging
      to new group generic matrixOps.  From Tomasz Kalinowski's
      contribution in PR#18483.

    * New function array2DF() to convert arrays to data frames,
      particularly useful for the list arrays created by tapply().

  DATES and TIMES:

    * On platforms where (non-UTC) datetimes before 1902 (or before
      1900 as with system functions on recent macOS) are guessed by
      extrapolating time zones from 1902-2037, there is a warning at
      the first use of extrapolation in a session.  (As all time zones
      post 2037 are extrapolation, we do not warn on those.)

    * (Platforms using --with-internal-tzone, including Windows and by
      default macOS). How years are printed in dates or date-times can
      be controlled by environment variable R_PAD_YEARS_BY_ZERO.  The
      default remains to pad to 4 digits by zeroes, but setting value
      no gives no padding (as used by default by glibc).

    * strftime() tries harder to determine the offset for the "%z"
      format, and succeeds on the mainstream R platforms.

    * strftime() has a limit of 2048 bytes on the string produced -
      attempting to exceed this is an error.  (Previously it silently
      truncated at 255 bytes.)

    * sessionInfo() records (and by default prints) the system time
      zone as part of the locale information.  Also, the source
      (system/internal) of the date-time conversion and printing
      functions.

    * Objects of class "POSIXlt" created in this version of R always
      have 11 components: component zone is always set, and component
      gmtoff is set for times in UTC and usually set on the (almost
      all) platforms which have C-level support, otherwise is NA.

    * There are comprehensive validity checks on the structure of
      objects of class "POSIXlt" when converting (including formatting
      and printing).  (This avoids mis-conversions of hand-crafted
      objects.)

    * There is some support for using the native date-time routines on
      macOS: this is only viable on recent versions (e.g. 12.6 and 13)
      and does get wrong some historical changes (before 1900, during
      WWII).  Use of --with-internal-tzone remains the default.

    * as.POSIXct(<numeric>) and as.POSIXlt(.) (without specifying
      origin) now work.  So does as.Date(<numeric>).

    * as.Date.POSIXct(., tz) now treats several tz values, notably
      "GMT" as equivalent to "UTC", proposed and improved by Michael
      Chirico and Joshua Ulrich in PR#17674.

    * Experimental balancePOSIXlt() utility allows using "ragged" and
      or out-of-range "POSIXlt" objects more correctly, e.g., in
      subsetting and subassignments.  Such objects are now documented.

      More experimentally, a "POSIXlt" object may have an attribute
      "balanced" indicating if it is known to be filled or fully
      balanced.

    * Functions axis.Date() and axis.POSIXct() are rewritten to gain
      better default tick locations and better default formats by using
      prettyDate(). Thanks to Swetlana Herbrandt.

    * The mapping of Windows' names for time zones to IANA's 'Olson'
      names has been updated.  When ICU is available (it is by
      default), it is used to get a mapping for the current region set
      in Windows.  This can be overridden by setting environment
      variable TZ to the desired Olson name - see OlsonNames() for
      those currently available.

  GRAPHICS:

    * The graphics engine version, R_GE_version, has been bumped to 16
      and so packages that provide graphics devices should be
      reinstalled.

    * The grDevices and grid packages have new functions for rendering
      typeset glyphs, primarily: grDevices::glyphInfo() and
      grid::grid.glyph().

      Rendering of typeset glyphs is only supported so far on the
      Cairo-based graphics devices and on the pdf() and quartz()
      devices.

    * The defined behaviour for "clear" and "source" compositing
      operators (via grid::grid.group()) has been changed (to align
      better with simple interpretation of original Porter-Duff
      definitions).

    * Support for gradients, patterns, clipping paths, masks, groups,
      compositing operators, and affine transformations has been added
      to the quartz() device.

  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:

    * A system installation of generic LAPACK 3.10.0 or later will be
      preferred to the version in the R sources.

      configure option --with-lapack=no (equivalently --without-lapack)
      forces compilation of the internal LAPACK sources.

      If --with-lapack is not specified, a system liblapack is looked
      for and used if it reports version 3.10.0 or later and does not
      contain BLAS routines.

      Packages using LAPACK will need to be reinstalled if this changes
      to using an external library.

    * On aarch64 Linux platforms using GCC, configure now defaults to
      -fPIC (instead of -fpic), as desired in PR#18326.

    * configure now checks conversion of datetimes between POSIXlt and
      POSIXct around year 2020.  Failure (which has been seen on
      platforms missing tzdata) is fatal.

    * If configure option --with-valgrind-instrumentation is given
      value 1 or 2, option --with-system-valgrind-headers is now the
      default and ignored (with a warning).  It is highly recommended
      that the system headers are installed alongside valgrind: they
      are part of its packaging on some Linux distributions and
      packaged separately (e.g. in the valgrind-devel RPM) on others.
      configure will give a warning if they are not found.

      The system headers will be required in a future release of R to
      build with valgrind instrumentation.

    * libcurl 8.x is now accepted by configure: despite a change in
      major version number it changes neither API nor ABI.

  INSTALLATION on WINDOWS:

    * The makefiles and installer scripts for Windows have been
      tailored to Rtools43, an update of the Rtools42 toolchain.  It is
      based on gcc 12 and newer versions of MinGW-W64, binutils and
      libraries.  At this time R-devel can still be built using
      Rtools42 without changes, but when R-devel is installed via the
      installer, it will by default look for Rtools43.

    * Old make targets rsync-extsoft and 32-bit ones that are no longer
      needed have been removed.

    * Default builds (including for packages) no longer select C99.
      Thus the C standard used is the default for the compiler, which
      for the toolchain in Rtools43 is C17.  (This is consistent with
      Unix builds.)

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * The default C++ standard has been changed to C++17 where
      available (which it is on all currently checked platforms): if
      not C++14 or C++11 is used if available otherwise C++ is not
      supported.

    * USE_FC_LEN_T is the default: this uses the correct
      (compiler-dependent) prototypes for Fortran BLAS/LAPACK routines
      called from C/C++, and requires adjustment of many such calls -
      see 'Writing R Extensions' SS6.6.1.

    * There is initial support for C++23 as several compilers are now
      supporting -std=c++23 or -std=c++2b or similar.  As for C++20,
      there no additional configure checks for C++23 features beyond a
      check that the compiler reports a __cplusplus value greater than
      that in the C++20 standard.  C++ feature tests should be used.

    * There is support for a package to indicate the version of the C
      standard which should be used to compile it, and for the
      installing user to specify this.  In most cases R defaults to the
      C compiler's default standard which is C17 (a `bug-fix' of C11) -
      earlier versions of R or compilers may have defaulted to C99.

      Current options are:

      USE_C17 Use a standard that is at most C17.  The intention is to
          allow legacy packages to still be installed when later C
          standards become the default, including packages using new
          keywords as identifiers or with K&R-style function
          declarations.  This will use C17 if available, falling back
          to C11.

      USE_C90 Use the C90 (aka C89) standard.  (As that standard did
          not require compilers to identify that version, all we can
          verify is that the compiler does not claim to be using a
          later standard.  It may accept C99 features - for example
          clang accepts // to make comments.)

      USE_C99 Use the C99 standard. This should be rarely needed - it
          avoids the few new features of C11/C17 which can be useful if
          a package assumes them if C17 is specified and they are not
          implemented.

      USE_C23 Use C23 (or in future, later).  Compiler/library support
          for C23 is still being implemented, but LLVM clang from
          15.0.0 and the upcoming GCC 13 have quite extensive support.

      These can be specified as part of the SystemRequirements field in
      the package's DESCRIPTION file or _via_ options --use-C17 and so
      on of R CMD INSTALL and R CMD SHLIB.

      For further details see "Writing R Extensions" SS1.2.5.

    * (Windows) A src/Makefile.ucrt or src/Makefile.win file is now
      included after R_HOME/etcR_ARCH/Makeconf and so no longer needs
      to include that file itself.  Installation of a package with such
      a file now uses a site Makevars file in the same way as a package
      with a src/Makevars.win file would.

    * configure is now passed crucial variables such as CC and CFLAGS
      in its environment, as many packages were not setting them (as
      documented in 'Writing R Extensions' SS1.2).

      This has most effect where configure is used to compile parts of
      the package - most often by cmake or libtool which obfuscate the
      actual compile commands used.

      Also used for configure.win and configure.ucrt on Windows.

  FORTRAN FLAGS:

    * The flag -fno-optimize-sibling-calls is no longer forced for
      gfortran 7 and later.  It should no longer be needed now using
      'hidden' character-length arguments when calling BLAS/LAPACK
      routines from C/C++ is the default even for packages.  (Unless
      perhaps packages call Fortran code from C/C++ without using R's
      headers and without allowing for these arguments.)

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The deprecated S-compatibility macros DOUBLE_* in
      R_ext/Constants.h (included by R.h) have been removed.

    * The deprecated legacy typedefs of Sint and Sfloat in header R.h
      are no longer defined, and that header no longer includes header
      limits.h from C nor climits from C++.

    * New macro CAD5R() is provided in Rinternals.h and used in a few
      places in the R sources.

    * ALTREP now supports VECSXP vectors. Contributed by Gabor Csardi
      in PR#17620.

    * The Rcomplex definition (in header R_ext/Complex.h) has been
      extended to prevent possible mis-compilation when interfacing
      with Fortran (PR#18430).  The new definition causes compiler
      warnings with static initializers such as {1, 2}, which can be
      changed to {.r=1, .i=2}.

      Using the new definition from C++ depends on compiler extensions
      supporting C features that have not been incorporated into the
      C++ standards but are available in g++ and clang++: this may
      result in C++ compiler warnings but these have been worked around
      for recent versions of common compilers (GCC, Apple/LLVM clang,
      Intel).

      It is intended to change the inclusion of header R_ext/Complex.h
      by other R headers, so C/C++ code files which make use of
      Rcomplex should include that header explicitly.

  UTILITIES:

    * R CMD check does more checking of package .Rd files, warning
      about invalid email addresses and (some) invalid URIs and noting
      empty \item labels in description lists.

    * R CMD check now also reports problems when reading package news
      in md (file NEWS.md) and (optionally) plain text (file NEWS)
      formats.

    * _R_CHECK_TIMINGS_ defaults to a value from the environment even
      for R CMD check --as-cran; this allows for exceptionally fast or
      slow platforms.

      It now applies to checking PDF and HTML versions of the manuals,
      and 'checking CRAN incoming feasibility'.

    * R CMD check can optionally (but included in --as-cran) check
      whether HTML math rendering _via_ KaTeX works for the package .Rd
      files.

    * Non-interactive debugger invocations can be trapped by setting
      the environment variable _R_CHECK_BROWSER_NONINTERACTIVE_ to a
      true value.  This is enabled by R CMD check --as-cran to detect
      the use of leftover browser() statements in the package.

    * The use of sprintf and vsprintf from C/C++ has been deprecated in
      macOS 13 and is a known security risk.  R CMD check now reports
      (on all platforms) if their use is found in compiled code:
      replace by snprintf or vsnprintf respectively. [*NB:* whether
      such calls get compiled into the package is platform-dependent.]

    * Where recorded at installation, R CMD check reports the C and
      Fortran compilers used to build R.

      It reports the OS in use (if known, as given by osVersion) as
      well as that R was built for.

      It notes if a C++ standard was specified which is older than the
      current default: many packages have used C++11 to mean 'not
      C++98' - as C++11 is the minimum supported since R 4.0.0, that
      specification can probably be removed.

    * R CMD INSTALL reports the compilers (and on macOS, the SDK) used,
      and this is copied to the output of R CMD check.

      Where a C++ standard is specified, it is reported.

    * R CMD check's 'checking compilation flags in Makevars' has been
      relaxed to accept the use of flags such as -std=f2008 in
      PKG_FFLAGS.

    * tools::buildVignettes() has a new argument skip, which is used by
      R CMD check to skip (and note) vignettes with unavailable
      \VignetteDepends (PR#18318).

    * New generic .AtNames() added to enable class-specific completions
      after @. The formerly internal function findMatches() is now
      exported, mainly for use in methods for .DollarNames() and
      .AtNames().

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * default.stringsAsFactors() is defunct.

    * Calling as.data.frame.<class>() directly (for 12 atomic classes)
      is going to be formally deprecated, currently activated by
      setting the environment variable
      _R_CHECK_AS_DATA_FRAME_EXPLICIT_METHOD_ to non-empty, which also
      happens in R CMD check --as-cran.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Hashed environments with sizes less than 5 can now grow.
      (Reported to R-devel by Duncan Garmonsway.)

    * as.character(<Rd>, deparse = TRUE) failed to re-escape curly
      braces in LaTeX-like text.  (Reported by Hadley Wickham in
      PR#18324.)

    * library() now passes its lib.loc argument when requiring Depends
      packages; reported (with fix) in PR#18331 by Mikael Jagan.

    * R CMD Stangle: improved message about 'Output' files.

    * head(x, n) and tail(x, n) now signal an error if n is not
      numeric, instead of incidentally "working" sometimes returning
      all of x.  Reported and discussed by Colin Fay, in PR#18357.

    * The "lm" method for summary() now gives the correct F-statistic
      when the model contains an offset.  Reported in PR#18008.

    * C() and `contrasts<-`() now preserve factor level names when
      given a function object (as opposed a function name which did
      preserve names). Reported in PR#17616.

    * c(a = 1, 2)[[]] no longer matches 2 but rather signals a
      _classed_ error.  Reported and analysed by Davis Vaughan in
      PR#18367, a duplicate of PR#18004, by Jan Meis et al.  For
      consistency, NULL[[]] is also erroneous now.  x[[]] <- v gives an
      error of the same class "MissingSubscriptError".

    * The relist() function of utils now supports NULL elements in the
      skeleton (PR#15854).

    * ordered(levels = *) (missing x) now works analogously to factor(,
      ordered=TRUE); reported (with fix) by Achim Zeileis in PR#18389.

    * User-defined Rd macro definitions can now span multiple lines,
      thanks to a patch from Duncan Murdoch. Previously, the Rd parser
      silently ignored everything after the first line.

    * Plain-text help (tools::Rd2txt()) now preserves an initial blank
      line for text following description list items.

    * tools::Rd2HTML() and tools::Rd2latex() no longer split \arguments
      and \value lists at Rd comments.

    * tools::Rd2latex() now correctly handles optional text outside
      \items of argument lists as well as bracketed text at the
      beginning of sections, e.g., \value{[NULL]}.

    * as.character(<POSIXt>) now behaves more in line with the methods
      for atomic vectors such as numbers, and is no longer influenced
      by options().  Ditto for as.character(<Date>).  The
      as.character() method gets arguments digits and OutDec with
      defaults _not_ depending on options().  Use of as.character(*,
      format = .) now warns.

    * Similarly, the as.character.hexmode() and *.octmode() methods
      also behave as good citizen methods and back compatibility option
      keepStr = TRUE.

    * The as.POSIXlt(<POSIXlt>) and as.POSIXct(<POSIXct>) default
      methods now do obey their tz argument, also in this case.

    * as.POSIXlt(<Date>) now does apply a tz (time zone) argument, as
      does as.POSIXct(); partly suggested by Roland Fuss on the R-devel
      mailing list.

    * as.Date.POSIXlt(x) now also works when the list components are of
      unequal length, aka "partially filled" or "ragged".

    * expand.model.frame() looked up variables in the wrong environment
      when applied to models fitted without data.  Reported in
      PR#18414.

    * time() now (also) uses the ts.eps = getOption("ts.eps") argument
      and thus by default rounds values very close to the start (or
      end) of a year.  Based on a proposal by Andre"i V. Kostyrka on
      R-help.

    * Printing of a factanal() result with just one factor and sort =
      TRUE now works regularly, fixing PR#17863 by Timothy Bates,
      thanks to the 'R Contributors' working group.

    * Printing 0-length objects of class "factor", "roman", "hexmode",
      "octmode", "person", "bibentry", or "citation" now prints
      something better, one of which fixes PR#18422, reported by
      Benjamin Feakins.

    * Sys.timezone() queries timedatectl only if systemd is loaded;
      addressing a report by Jan Gorecki in PR#17421.

    * The formula method of cor.test() had scoping problems when
      environment(formula) was not the calling environment; reported
      with a patch proposal by Mao Kobayashi in PR#18439.

    * attach() of an environment with active bindings now preserves the
      active bindings.  Reported by Kevin Ushey in PR#18425.

    * BLAS detection now works also with system-provided libraries not
      available as regular files.  This fixes detection of the
      Accelerate framework on macOS since Big Sur.  Reported by David
      Novgorodsky.

    * download.file() gives a helpful error message in case of an
      invalid download.file.method option, thanks to Colin Fay's report
      in PR#18455.

    * Sporadic crashes of Rterm when using completion have been fixed.

    * Rprof() is now more reliable.  A livelock in thread
      initialization with too short sampling interval has been fixed on
      macOS.  A deadlock in using the C runtime has been fixed on
      Windows.  A potential deadlock has been prevented on Unix.

    * Cursor placement in Rgui now works even after a fixed-width font
      is selected.

    * Mandatory options (options()) are now set on startup so that
      saving and restoring them always works (PR#18372).

    * Package installation, R CMD INSTALL or install.packages(*), now
      parses each of the <pkg>/R/*.R files individually instead of
      first concatenating and then parse()ing the large resulting file.
      This allows parser or syntax errors to be diagnosed with correct
      file names and line numbers, thanks to Simon Dedman's report and
      Bill Dunlap's patch in PR#17859.

      This _does_ require syntactically self contained R source files
      now, fixing another inadvertent bug.

    * predict.lm(<model with offset>) now finds the offset in the
      correct environment, thanks to Andr'e Gillibert's report and patch
      in PR#18456.

    * getInitial(<formula>) now finds the selfStart model in the
      correct environment.  (Reported by Ivan Krylov in PR#18368.)

    * Fix for possible segfault when using recently-added graphics
      features, such as gradients, clipping paths, masks, and groups
      with pdf(file=NULL).

    * class(m) <- class(m) no longer changes a matrix m by adding a
      class _attribute_.

    * packageDate(pkg) now only warns once if there is no pkg.

    * When ts() creates a multivariate time series, "mts", it also
      inherits from "array" now, and is.mts() is documented _and_
      stricter.

    * Rd2txt() now preserves line breaks of \verb Rd content and from
      duplicated \cr.  The former also fixes the rendering of verbatim
      output from Rd \Sexpr in plain-text help.

    * uniroot(f, interval) should no longer wrongly converge _outside_
      the interval in some cases where abs(f(x)) == Inf for an x at the
      interval boundary, thanks to posts by Ben Bolker and Serguei
      Sokol on R-devel.

    * Vectorized alpha handling in palette functions such as in gray(),
      rainbow(), or hcl.colors() works correctly now, thanks to Achim
      Zeileis' report and patch in PR#18476.

    * Formatting and print()ing of bibentry objects has dropped the
      deprecated citation.bibtex.max argument, such that the bibtex
      argument's default for print.bibentry() depends directly on the
      citation.bibtex.max option, whereas in format.bibentry() the
      option no longer applies.

    * Attempting to use a character string naming a foreign function
      entry point in a foreign function call in a package will now
      signal an error if the packages has called R_forceSymbols to
      specify that symbols must be used.

    * An error in table() could permanently set options(warn=2)
      promoting all subsequent warnings to errors.

    * The sigma() function gave misleading results for binary GLMs.  A
      new method for objects of class "glm" returns the square root of
      the estimate of the dispersion parameter using the same
      calculation as summary.glm().

    * bs() and ns() in the (typical) case of automatic knot
      construction, when some of the supposedly inner knots coincide
      with boundary knots, now moves them inside (with a warning),
      building on PR#18442 by Ben Bolker.

    * R CMD on Windows now skips the site profile with --no-site-file
      and --vanilla even when R_PROFILE is set (PR#18512, from Kevin
      Ushey).

Message-ID: <CAAsRM+CLSMKrgRQ5ddxbdE8X_Lxzw6X2K5FtQ_CZDwFH5ndjAg@mail.gmail.com>

With the support of the R Foundation Conference Committee, we are happy to
announce the promotion of regional R events to connect our R community and
bridge us till useR! 2024.

On July 21st we hold an event in Basel, with all ticket sales for the
Basel event being directly donated to the R Foundation. Similar events are
being planned in Shanghai and San Francisco this summer.

Basel event link (call for abstracts is currently open):
https://user-regional-2023.gitlab.io/basel/

We also wanted to help promote events beyond those organised in
collaboration with the R Foundation and R User Group (RUGs), so are hosting
this dashboard of R events this summer which will also include the Shanghai
and San Francisco events when they are launched:

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

CHANGES IN R 4.3.1:

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The C-level API version of R's integrate(), Rdqags() in Applic.h,
      now returns the correct number of integrand evaluations neval,
      fixing PR#18515 reported and diagnosed by Stephen Wade.

    * The C prototypes for LAPACK calls dspgv and dtptrs in
      R_exts/Lapack.h had one too many and one too few character length
      arguments - but this has not caused any known issues. To get the
      corrected prototypes, include

              #include <Rconfig.h> // for PR18534fixed
              #ifdef PR18534fixed
              # define usePR18534fix 1
              #endif
              #include <R_exts/Lapack.h>
      
      in your C/C++ code (PR#18534).

  INSTALLATION:

    * Many of the checks of esoteric Internet operations and those
      using unreliable external sites have been moved to a new target
      that is not run by default and primarily intended for the core
      developers.  To run them use

              cd tests; make test-Internet-dev
      
  BUG FIXES:

    * .S3methods(), typically called from methods(), again marks
      methods from package base as visible.

      Also, the visibility of non-base methods is again determined by
      the method's presence in search().

    * tools::Rdiff() is now more robust against invalid strings, fixing
      installation tests on Windows without Rtools installed
      (PR#18530).

    * Fix (new) bug in hcl.colors(2, *), by Achim Zeileis (PR#18523).

    * head(., <illegal>) and tail(..) now produce more useful "Error in
      ...." error messages, fixing PR#18362.

    * Package code syntax on Windows is checked in UTF-8 when UTF-8 is
      the native encoding.

    * na.contiguous(x) now also returns the first run, when it is at
      the beginning and there is a later one of the same length;
      reported to R-devel, including a fix, by Georgi Boshnakov.
      Further, by default, it modifies only an existing attr(*,"tsp")
      but otherwise no longer sets one.

    * chol(<not pos.def>, pivot = <T|F>) now gives a correct error or
      warning message (depending on pivot), thanks to Mikael Jagan's
      (PR#18541).
