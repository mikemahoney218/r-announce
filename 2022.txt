Subject: [Rd] R 4.1.3 is released
Message-ID: <3523D985-CFB4-415A-A07F-A8F1A745ED0A@cbs.dk>

The build system rolled up R-4.1.3.tar.gz (codename "One Push-Up") this morning.

The list below details the changes in this release. 

You can get the source code from

https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.1.3.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.


For the R Core Team,

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

CHANGES IN R 4.1.3:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The default version of Bioconductor has been changed to 3.14.
      (This is used by setRepositories and the menus in GUIs.)

  UTILITIES:

    * R CMD check --as-cran has a workaround for a bug in versions of
      file up to at least 5.41 which mis-identify DBF files last
      changed in 2022 as executables.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The legacy S-compatibility macros SINGLE_* in R_ext/Constants.h
      (included by R.h) are deprecated and will be removed in R 4.2.0.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Initialization of self-starting nls() models with initialization
      functions following the pre-R-4.1.0 API (without the ...
      argument) works again for now, with a deprecation warning.

    * Fixed quoting of ~autodetect~ in Java setting defaults to avoid
      inadvertent user lookup due to leading ~, reported in PR#18231 by
      Harold Gutch.

    * substr(., start, stop) <- v now treats _negative_ stop values
      correctly.  Reported with a patch in PR#18228 by Brodie Gaslam.

    * Subscripting an array x without dimnames by a
      length(dim(x))-column character matrix gave "random" non-sense,
      now an error; reported in PR#18244 by Mikael Jagan.

    * ...names() now matches names(list(...)) closely, fixing PR#18247.

    * all.equal(*, scale = s) now works as intended when length(s) > 1,
      partly thanks to Michael Chirico's PR#18272.

    * print(x) for long vectors x now also works for named atomic
      vectors or lists and prints the correct number when reaching the
      getOption("max.print") limit; partly thanks to a report and
      proposal by Hugh Parsonage to the R-devel list.

    * all.equal(<selfStart>, *) no longer signals a deprecation
      warning.

    * reformulate(*, response=r) gives a helpful error message now when
      length(r) > 1, thanks to Bill Dunlap's PR#18281.

    * Modifying globalCallingHandlers inside withCallingHandlers() now
      works or fails correctly, thanks to Henrik Bengtsson's PR#18257.

    * hist(<Date>, breaks = "days") and hist(<POSIXt>, breaks = "secs")
      no longer fail for inputs of length 1.

    * qbeta(.001, .9, .009) and similar cases now converge correctly
      thanks to Ben Bolker's report in PR#17746.

    * window(x, start, end) no longer wrongly signals "'start' cannot
      be after 'end'", fixing PR#17527 and PR#18291.

    * data() now checks that its (rarely used) list argument is a
      character vector - a couple of packages passed other types and
      gave incorrect results.

    * which() now checks its arr.ind argument is TRUE rather coercing
      to logical and taking the first element - which gave incorrect
      results in package code.

    * model.weights() and model.offset() more carefully extract their
      model components, thanks to Ben Bolker and Tim Taylor's R-devel
      post.

    * list.files(recursive = TRUE) now shows all broken symlinks
      (previously, some of them may have been omitted, PR#18296).

Dear All,

The R Foundation Conference Committee invites proposals to organize useR! 2023 as a global online conference:

The call is open to teams worldwide and the deadline for outline proposals is **Friday 22 April 2022**. 

Any queries should be sent to R-conferences at r-project.org (after a careful read of the call!).
