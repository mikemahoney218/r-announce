Subject: New version 0.61.1
Message-ID: <x2oh1jc60k.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


The R core team proudly presents:

       \||||||||/
       -R 0.61.1-
       /||||||||\


I've just rolled together a new patch release.

It's available from the Auckland repository now, but please do not get
it from there unless you are in a terrible hurry. It should find its
way to the main CRAN site in Vienna this evening and then to the rest
of the CRAN sites. 

There's also a patch file, R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.gz, which you can apply
to an existing R-0.61 tree. Note that the proper patch procedure is as
follows -- assuming that your current working directory is the top
directory of R-0.61 and the patch file is in the parent directory.

gzip -dc ../R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.gz | patch -E -p1

or on most installations, equivalently

zcat ../R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.gz | patch -E -p1

The above requires that you have GNU "patch" installed. At least one
system (Solaris) ships with a different "patch", which exhibits some
annoying bits of braindamage. If you want to use it, you're on your
own...

I removed changes to the file src/main/gram.c from the patchfile,
because they amounted almost two thirds of the patchfile and the file
is automatically generated from src/main/gram.y anyway. 

A few systems may not have a parser generator installed, and for the
benefit of those, I've also put up a R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.w.gram.c.gz
file. Note that you may need a "touch src/main/gram.c" to prevent
"make" from trying to rebuild it.

Here's the list of changes relative to 0.61 (from the CHANGES file):

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   None (by definition, x.y.z releases are bugfix releases now)

BUG FIXES

    o   Return statements of the form return(x,y) will now return
        a list with named components.

    o   Parsing of nested "if" statments was broken.  This is fixed now.
        (Reported by Paul Gilbert).

    o   Wrong declaration of ConsoleBufCnt in src/main/scan.c caused crash
        in Irix (George White <gwhite at bodnext.bio.dfo.ca>)

    o   if(nmatch = 0) bug in src/main/character.c fixed (Doug Bates)

    o   R_alloc/S_alloc fixes. The former allocated 4 times more than
        needed, the latter zeroed half of what it got, sizeof() mistakes
        in both cases.

    o   c(ordered factor) caused segfault (uninitalised pointer), now
        fixed.

    o   behaviour of as.numeric() on factors changed recently; now
        documented.

    o   model.matrix() now pays attention to the names on its dataframe
        argument.

    o   Fixes to group methods.

    o   autoload() caused infinite loop if function  wasn't found in
        library on loading

    o   The pager ate the rest of stdin in batch mode, now fixed. Also,
        stdout was not flushed before call to system(). "make tests"
        should work now.

    o   Empty directories now created by configure (so that it doesn't
        matter that "CVS export" doesn't do it)

    o   as.name() made idempotent (i.e. if is.name(x) then as.name(x)==x)

    o   3 problems with glm, 2 in glm.fit and a one in print.glm fixed
        [Jim Lindsey]

    o   binomial (family) now works when 'n=0'. [J.Lindsey]

    o   split() now also works in split(1:10,1:2)

    o   strsplit() now also works for strsplit(c,NULL)

    o   A LANG='..' environment variable no longer affects  scan()ing of
        numbers.

    o   seq(.) doesn't segfault anymore in  gl(2,3):gl(1,6)

    o   contour(.) now also works with integer arguments

From pgilbert at bank-banque-canada.ca  Fri Jan 16 17:50:36 1998

Subject: DSE time series package
Message-ID: <98Jan16.115834est.13454@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

===============================================================

                     ANNOUNCEMENT

===============================================================

An R version of my multivariate time series package (DSE) is now available at
CRAN/src/contrib/devel/dse.v.98.1alphaR.tar.gz and it should be reflected
at the mirrors shortly. The User's Guide is available at

  http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/pgilbert

HTML help documentation is distributed with the code and is also available
at the above web site. (The web page is a bit out of date but I hope to fix
that soon.)

The tar file includes two other packages which may be of interest by themselves.

The first, called syskern, provides a kernel of functions for S/R programmers
which is intended to help write code which is independent of operating system
differences and some small differences between S and R.
The second, called tframe, provides a kernel of functions for programming time
series methods relatively independently of the representation of time.
This is intended to make it easier to write code which can use any new/better
time representations when they appear. It also provides plotting, windowing,
and some other utility functions which are specifically intended for time
series.

The DSE library implements an object oriented approach to time series
models (using classes and methods in R/S). This means that different
model representations can be implemented with fairly simple extensions
to the library. The original library included multi-variate state space
and ARMA (including VAR) models. The current version implements Troll
models as another class. These are run by completely separate software
(Troll from Intex Inc.) as if they were an integral part of the
library. Models and data are passed back and forth to Troll and the
results can be analyzed with already existing functions in the
library.  This also serves as an example for including other classes
and methods. [The Troll interface is not yet functional in R.]

Methods for simulating, estimating, and converting among different
model representations form the basic part of the library. Methods for
studying estimation methods and for examining the forecasting properties
of models are also documented in the User Guide.

Relative to commercial packages the library is especially useful for
time series research (such as studying estimation methods) and for
teaching. For usual time series applications there may be commercial
packages which are preferable.

A list server for questions and discussion of problems has also been set up.

To subscribe to the list send a message to
with a line in the body:

subscribe boc_dse Your Name

Subsequent message submissions to the list should be sent to
boc_dse at bank-banque-canada.ca


Caveats for R

I have tested the package with R0.61.1 in Solaris and R0.61 in Linux. I would
appreciate feedback about other OSs. The install procedures are currently Unix
specific (I believe) but if anyone attempts installing in Windows I would be
especially interested in knowing how to do this.

The package has been put in the devel area of CRAN because there are still
some things I would like to fix (although it is mostly working well), and
because the documentation has not been revised. I would appreciate any early
feedback as I would like to fix as many problems as possible before moving
this out of the devel category.

The package is divided into several parts, some logical and some because
the current version of R does not support large libraries.

Beware that some documentation in the code, in the HTML based help system,
and in the Brief Users' Guide is still somewhat specific to S and is not
correct for R (particularly with respect to installation). See the READ.ME
file for instruction to install in R.

Thanks to Martyn Plummer there are new Linux RedHat 5.0 packages of R
on CRAN which have been built on a RedHat System, so all dependencies
should be ok.

I have uploaded them yesterday, so they should have made it to most
mirrors by now.

As mentioned earlier I want to decentralize the package descriptions
of all contributed packages:

Please make sure to include a file called DESCRIPTION in every package
which looks like:

**********************************************************

Package: e1071
Version: 0.7-3
Author: Compiled by Fritz Leisch <Friedrich.Leisch at ci.tuwien.ac.at>.
Description: Miscellaneous functions used at the Department of
        Statistics at TU Wien (E1071). 
Copyright: GPL

**********************************************************

Further you can use a field called `Depends:' to include a
comma-seperated list of pre-requisited packages.

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE A COPYRIGHT LINE IN THE DESCRIPTION!!!

Continuation lines begin with a whitespace character (as in
Description above).

You can take the file $CRAN/src/contrib/PACKAGES as templates (but
don't forget to add the Copyright line :-). This file will be built
automatically by concatenating all DESCRIPTION files.

To all maintainers of current packages: Could you please update the
packages by including the DESCRIPTION file?

Best,
Fritz

likelihood and density estimation models, in the spirit
of loess but with many additional features. To install,
unpack the locfit_19980309.tar.gz file, and
R INSTALL locfit

Most of the functionality and examples on my home page
http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/project/locfit/ should work
in R, with the exception of trellis displays.

Thanks to Kurt Hornik for helping with the port and testing.

Subject: R-0.61.2 released
Message-ID: <x2g1khh1ar.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


R-0.61.2.tgz is now available from the Auckland FTP site, from where
it should spread to the CRAN sites during the next day or two. Unless
you're in a big hurry or actually living in New Zealand, please don't
get it from Auckland. 

There is also an R-0.61.1-0.61.2.diff.gz which can be used to patch an
existing R-0.61.1. Instructions for patching are in the VERSION file
in same directory.

This release mainly fixes a number of trivial bugs (segfaults from
strange constructions and the like). One major change is that the
changes to factor coercion that was introduced previously was deemed
to be buggy after all, so now as.numeric(factor(100,200)) == 1:2
again. A few features was also allowed to trickle down from the 0.62
as-yet-unreleased version.

Jim Lindsey will probably be disappointed in finding that his
favourite model formula bugs are still there. This is not because we
disagree that they are bugs or have forgotten all about them, but
fixing it turned out to require more substantial changes than we cared
to introduce in a patch release.

This release was made primarily to be included in the Debian Linux 2.0
release. For this reason the problems with non-GNU make programs have
not been touched at all.

Subject: A new port of R to MS Windows on CRAN
Message-ID: <199803261359.OAA14588@galadriel.ci.tuwien.ac.at>


Hi,

I've included Guido Masarotto's port of R 0.61.1 to MS Windows 95/NT
in $CRAN/bin/ms-windows-32 ... you can find both the sources and
binaries there.

I include Guido's README below.

Thanks again to Guido for making this port available!

Best,
Fritz Leisch



**********************************************************

rgnwbin.tgz and rgnwsrc.tgz are the first results of an attempt to
build R for Win95 and WinNT using egcs-mingw32.

The advantages over the binaries for MsWindows that can be found in CRAN
are:
1. R seems to run faster. Some simple (perhaps too simple)
   benchmarks point to a 20% gain.
2. The port is based on a more recent version (0.61.1) and it is more
   complete (more "system calls": system, tempfile, unlink, 
   WinExec - to launch applications without waiting for the result;
   support for the standard help system: try help(), help(abline),
   help(line,eda), ?women, data(), library())
3. A new menu item "Stop current computation" make  possible 
   to interupt long computation (but only when  something is printed).
4. Since egcs-mingw32 uses the standard C calling convention, 
   you don't need a Watcom compiler to build dynamic link libraries.
   Indeed, this was my original motivation.
5. It should be easy to use some other gnu-win32 compilers (maybe
   running on a non MsWindows machine). It should be easy to 
   adapt the port to lcc-win32, too.
   
But remember: this is experimental code so
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      USE IT AT YOUR RISK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

BINARY DISTRIBUTION
Just unpack rgwnbin.tgz somewhere.
The executable is R.GNW\bin\R.exe. This binary distribution
includes only the standard packages (base+eda+mva+stepfun).

SOURCE DISTRIBUTION
This is an add-on to the R-0.61.1 distribution.
So unpack R-0.61.1.tar.gz somewhere.
Then, from the same directory, unpack rgwnsrc.tgz.
To rebuild the system, go to R-0.61.1/src/gnuwin32.
Then
   > make
should build the standard stuff.
To add a new package, you should
a) download it; 
b) unpack it in the R-0.61.1/src directory.
c) go to the R-0.61.1/src/gnuwin32 directory and type
   > make pkg-xxx
   where xxx is the name of the package.
   You should get the directory R-0.61.1/library/xxx
   and its subdirectory R/ (the r-code) data/ (the 
   data of the package) R/libs (the dynamic link library) and
   the support for the help system (INDEX, TITLE, an updated
   LibIndex). Of course, the data and libs subdirectory
   can be missing.
d) if you want the documentation, you can download 
   the preformatted one.Then  unpack it in the R-0.61.1
   (not in the R-0.61.1/src) directory. If you don't need
   the LaTeX files, remove them.

Note:
(1) Of course, you need a compiler. As I have said I used 
    the egcs-mingw32 one:
    http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/
(2) You must also have a GNU make and some standard unix
    command (ls,cat,sed,rm). Furthemore, make and this
    command must be able to overcome the MsDOS limitation
    about the length of a command.
    I used the ones coming with the djgpp compiler.
    According to me, they are the best version for dos and
    windows. You can find it in any SIMTEL mirror.
    If you want, I can make available a small file with
    only the needed tools.
(3) The gnuwin32/Makefile use the g77 Fortran compiler.
    If you don't have it, or if you don't want to use it,
    you can use something like
      > make HAVEG77=NO 
    or
      > make HAVEG77=NO pkg-xxx
    For example, the g77 compiler in egcs-mingw32 was
    not able to compile the fortran code in the acepack package.
    However, I was able to build this package with the command
      > make HAVEG77=NO pkg-acepack
(4) When installing a package, if in R-0.61.1/src/library/xxx/R
    exist a file with name yyy.gnw then this file is used
    and files with name yyy or yyy.somethingelse are
    ignored. In this way, you can configure the R code
    of the package. An example is the base/R/system.gnw
    file.
(5) This is not a developer's distribution. For example, dependences
    are written in a silly way. Furthemore, all the code
    in src/appl/, src/appl-f,..... is compiled.
    No use of the original Makefile is done.
    Hence, you have to start from a cleaned distribution.


BUGS and TODO
(0) The English of this README.
(1) If you exit from the edit windows and this is empty you get a
    segmentation fault. This happens also on my Linux box. So,
    it seem to be a general problem.
(2) The dll's are statically linked with the other R code.
    So they get support for the routines that they need.
    In this way, they work but are big. We should have
    a large R.dll with all the standard code. Then 
    the executable and the dll's should simply import
    from R.dll.
(3) Try and adapt this port to other win32 compiler.
    It should be easy. So, why don't try?
(4) The system command does not work if the command to be
    execute require some user interaction. It is just a 
    "simulated  reading pipe for a broken OS".
(5) I inserted an event loop at the beginning of the
    function which print to the console. In this way,
    you can interupt the computation or, for example,
    give the focus to the graphics window.
    But only when you print. A call to the event loop
    must be inserted inside the "main" code.
    But, for the moment, I decided to leave the "main"
    code untouched.
(6) When building package xxx, all the C and Fortran files
    found in library/xxx/src (or library/xxx/src-c if
    you don't have the g77 compiler) are compiled
    and putted in a dll. On the contrary, we have to make
    use of the original Makefile.
(7) The Windows code must be cleaned.

Subject: R-0.61.3 released
Message-ID: <x267jojuis.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>


I've just put up R-0.61.3.tgz and R-0.61.2-0.61.3.diff.gz for
anonymous FTP on ftp.stat.auckland.ac.nz. 

As usual: Don't get it from there unless you are in a desperate hurry.
It will migrate to the CRAN sites within a day or two. (See the FAQ
for the list of CRAN sites. And see the footer for the FAQ location....)

This release mainly fixes a couple of embarassing bugs in 0.61.2. It
is expected to be the last of the 0.61.x series (unless something
*really* ghastly is discovered), 0.62.0 being scheduled for release
some time in mid-June.

Here is the list of changes:


                CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61.3

NEW FEATURES

    o   find(.) function [on wish of many...]

BUG FIXES

    o   Remove "Alpha" revision from opening blurb. Didn't make sense
        with our development model

    o   set SHELL=/bin/sh in Makefile and use $(MAKE). Avoid use of 
        wildcards in $(MANSRC) for non-gnu "make" (notably Solaris).

    o   rhyper gave wrong results in degenerate cases

    o   Using get with pos=length(search()) or envir=NULL was
        actually actually starting the search in .GlobalEnv.

    o   first=0 (or negative) argument to substr() caused trouble.

    o   1%o%1 would segfault

    o   .Dyn.libs would linger in .RData causing code not to be dyn.loaded.
        Now removed in .First(), if necessary

    o   system.time() expression could not access local variables in
        functions.

From plummer at iarc.fr  Fri May 22 11:05:46 1998
From: plummer at iarc.fr (Martyn Plummer)
Date: Fri, 22 May 1998 09:05:46 -0000 ()
Subject: CODA package for R
Message-ID: <XFMail.980522094346.plummer@iarc.fr>

I have just uploaded the R port of the CODA (Convergence Diagnostics
and Output Analysis) package to CRAN.  This is a suite of functions
for analyzing the output of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations and
diagnosing lack of convergence of the simulated output.  It is designed
to work with (but is not necessarily limited to) the BUGS program:
http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/ 

I have made substantial changes to the original S code, not just to make
the package run under R but to put the code on a more sound basis. The
R version also includes a license change to GPL.

I have tried to maintain the functionality of the original, while at the
same time allowing experienced R users to free themselves from the menu
driven interface.  The graphics are a bit rough, but apart from that it
works well in testing here. More testing and feedback from others is,
of course, welcome.

Since the R version is very different you should refer to the online
help rather than the existing CODA manual.

From guido at sirio.stat.unipd.it  Fri May 22 14:32:05 1998
From: guido at sirio.stat.unipd.it (guido at sirio.stat.unipd.it)

Subject: R-0.61.3 for Win95/NT available
Message-ID: <19980522123205.10247.qmail@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

I have just put on ftp://sirio.stat.unipd.it/pub/R a new version 
of R for Win95/NT.
The main difference concerns dynamic linking (see below).
In addition, the binary distribution contains many of the 
available packages (all the ones that I have installed on
my Unix machine).
In the afternoon, I will upload the files on CRAN.
g.m.

This is the README file:
rw0613b.zip is  a new binary distribution of R (based on the last "stable"
version, 0.61.3) for Win95 and WinNT. It is compiled using  egcs-minw32.
rw0613s.zip contains the MsWindows sources.

News
(a) Now, a dll can call a routine in the main executable. This
    means that call_S, R_alloc,... work. Try, for example,
    demo(dyn.load).
    All R.exe (non static) functions and all global variables
    are exported.
    In this way, more packages can be ported and furthermore
    the size of the dll cuts down.
(b) I fixed a nasty bug which made impossible to set the
    memory size. Now, R -v VVVV -n NNNN works.
(c) There is a new command line switch -home aDir which
    sets for the current run the HOME directory.
    Workspace and user RProfile file are  searched in HOME.
    In addition, now tempfile() try to use the environmental variables 
    TMP, TEMP and HOME (in this order).
(d) The following packages are included in the binary distribution:
      acepack    ace() and avas() for selecting regression transformations 
      base       The R base package 
      bootstrap  Functions for the Book "An Introduction to the Bootstrap" 
      class      Functions for classification 
      ctest      Classical Tests 
      eda        Exploratory Data Analysis 
      gee        Generalized Estimating Equation models  
      integrate  numerical integration 
      leaps      Regression subset selection 
      locfit     Local Regression, Likelihood and Density Estimtion. 
      mva        Classical Multivariate Analysis 
      polymars   (polychotomous) regression based on  
                 Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines 
      polynom    A collection of functions to implement a class for  
		 univariate polynomial manipulations 
      spatial    functions for kriging and point pattern analysis 
      splines    Regression Spline Functions and Classes 
      stepfun    Step Functions, including Empirical Distributions 
      survival4  Survival analysis [needs library(splines)] 

    Of course, I cannot test all the functions. So, don't flame me
    if something doesn't work.
    

Installation (binary distribution)
Just unzip the archive. You will get a new directory (rw0613).
The executable is bin/R.exe.

Installation (sources)
First of all, you have to download and untar the complete sources.
Then, in the directory R-0.61.3, unzip rw0613s.zip.
To rebuild the system using egcs-mingw32 go to the src/gnuwin32
directory and type 
> make
This will build the main executable (in R-0.61.3/bin) and
the standard packages: base, eda, mva, stepfun.

Installing other packages
Uncompress the package you want in R-0.61.3/src/library.
Then, from the gnuwin32 directory, 
> make -f MakePkg -C ../library/xxx PKG=xxx [HAVEG77=NO] [DLLNAME=yyy]
will try to build the package xxx.
The HAVEG77=NO options must be used if:
(a) you don't have or don't want to use g77;
or
(b) the package has a src-c directory but not a src one.
The option DLLNAME=yyy must be used if the package requires a
dll with a name different from xxx.dll. For example, the dll
of integrate is adapt.dll.
If you don't need the two flags, you can use the short command
> make pkg-xxx
Compiler flags must be setted in MakeDll. Look to this file
for some example.


Help files
There are no support for generating the help files.
You have to download the pre-formatted one by any CRAN site or
to build them yourself on a Unix machine.

Tools
To rebuild the system and to install other packages, you need
not only a compiler but also some Gnu tools. The ones that I used,
coming from DJGPP, are  in djtools.zip.
You must uncompress this file from C:. It will expand
under usr/bin and usr/home.
To use the tools usr/bin must be in the PATH.
In djtools.zip, a version of bash is included.
I am not sure that you need it but I did all my work 
using it. To use bash, the environmental variable HOME
should point to /usr/home. You have to start bash, in a console
or a MsDos windows, with
> bash -login
If you install djtools.zip, please use the make in usr/bin not
the one of your compiler.

Subject: R-0.61.3 for MsWindows3.1+Win32s available
Message-ID: <19980527140645.522.qmail@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

I have just uploaded to CRAN a binary distribution of R for 
Windows3.1 + Win32s. 
You can also find it at ftp://sirio.stat.unipd.it/pub/R
guido m.

---------------------------readme.31----------------------------------------
rwin31b.zip contains a binary distribution of R-0.61.3 for MsWindows3.1
with Win32s installed. The executable and the dll's are compiled
with egcs-mingw32.
This distribution is equal to the one for Win95/NT (rw0613b.zip).
In particular, it contais the same packages (see README.95).
I simple modified one  line of the source which is never
executed under Win95/NT but which raises an error under Win31 
and converted (using the included Unix shell script win31.sh)
the names of the files to the MsDos 8.3 format. I hope to
have converted also the links in the html files.
Installation is easy: just unzip rwin31b.zip somewhere and
you will get a new directory (rw0613); the executable is
rw0613\bin\r.exe.

Notes:
(1) You need a recent version of Win32s. How much recent I don't know. 
    But r.exe doesn't work with version 1.30.142.0 and it works with 
    1.30.172.0. If you have a too old version of Win32s installed
    you will get get some message of the type "symbol xxxx not found
    in crtdll.dll". The Win32s version can be found in the file
    windows\system\win32s.ini.
    
(2) To load a package, you should use only the first 8 characters
    of the name, i.e., use
    > library(survival)
    not
    > library(survival4)
    
(3) The system() command doesn't work. I have no time now to understand 
    why so I put a dummy definition in library/Rprofile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember that this distribution is experimental. So, use it at your 
own risk. This distribution is not formally maintained, but I am interested 
in hearing (on r-devel and r-help) from people who have problems with it, 
although I may not be able to solve them.

Subject: MASS libraries for R
Message-ID: <199806041216.NAA01566@toucan.stats.ox.ac.uk>

We have made a nearly complete set of the V&R2 libraries for R.
These are in the devel section of contributions to CRAN as

	VR5.3pl021-1.tar.gz

and at

	http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/VR5.3pl021-1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/VR5.3pl021-1.tar.gz

They have been developed under a very recent snapshot, and this is
probably needed.  Also in that file is a set of scripts from the book
modified for use with R.

This is a beta-test version: we are interested to hear of your
experiences but will not support this seriously until R-0.62 is
released.  We are grateful to Kurt Hornik and Albrecht Gebhardt
for their work on earlier versions.

The current status is

MASS:		almost all working, the remaining things depend
		   on bug fixes or on Trellis, nls, ...
class		OK
nnet		OK
spatial		OK

To come are a R clone of the tree() software and of RPART, both
of which are done but need more testing.

Subject: R-0.62 is released
Message-ID: <x2ra0sujs9.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>

I've put up R-0.62.0.tgz up for FTP from Auckland some minutes ago.
As usual, don't get it from there unless you are desperate, but wait
for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

Note that beginning with this version, you need Fortran in some form
or other to compile R. (f2c is good enough)

Here is the relevant part of the CHANGES file:

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62

NEW FEATURES

    o   Many more help(.) pages.

    o   The top level Makefile now supports the usual
	   ./configure; make; make install
	procedure (new make targets `all' and `install').

    o   The HTML help pages can now be searched for keywords.

    o	Conversion of functions to and from lists. formals<- and body<-.
	The alist() function makes it easier to construct argument lists,
	etc. Added expression-->list coercion.

    o	complex(.) now has optional 'argument' and 'modulus' arguments,
	allowing ``polar coordinate'' specifications.

    o	layout() documented and improved: starts default device if needed, and
	returns number of figures.

    o	New find() function [relying on apropos(..)].

    o	objects(<integer>) now works, being equivalent to
	objects(pos=<int.>).

    o	storage.mode() and related functions now return
	"double" instead of "real", for compatibility.
	"real" is still allowed as synomym for "double".

    o	A tests/ directory has been added (in the source), and "make tests"
	has been modified to run more than all the examples from the base
	package.  The exact 'make tests' behavior is still bound to change.

    o	An experimental directory etc/Rdoc has been added with a perl5
	module to parse R documentation files.	Sample perl programs
	to use this module are also included.

    o	All internal mechanisms to support factors and data.frames
	have been removed.  These are now entirely supported by
	interpreted code! `is.unordered' has been eliminated.
	Thanks to John Chambers for allowing the distribution of his
	StatLib code.

    o	"pmatch" is now completely S compatible and is not just another
	name for "charmatch".

    o	There is now a function called ".Alias" which can be used to
	provide multiple names for the same object.  Example:
		lm2 <- .Alias(lm)
	This is dangerous because it can be used to defeat the
	call-by-value illusion.

    o	Many functions changed from <primitive> to .Internal(..).
	Currently, new .Internal(.)s in ..library/base/R/New-Internal.R
	Primitive functions are now printed as ``.Primitive(..)''.

    o	[dpqr]hyper(.) now also work with some 0 arguments.

    o	C-code: Many "-Wall" fixes (MM & DB).

    o	mva's dist() now takes arguments diag and upper which control
	how the distance matrix is printed. plot.hclust() now takes a
	labels argument.

    o	Attributes are now propagated correctly in binary operations.
	Changes from:
	  Steve Oncley and Gordon Maclean
	  National Center for Atmospheric Research
	  Boulder, Colorado USA

    o	configure now also checks for fort77.

    o	Usage of R INSTALL now is
	  R INSTALL [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n
	The +/- options were replaced by GNU-style `--no-docs' and
	`--no-text', `--no-html', and `--no-latex'.

    o	Usage of R REMOVE now is
	  R REMOVE [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n

    o	Usage of R COMPILE now is R COMPILE [options] srcfiles, where
	through options one can set e.g. CFLAGS or FFLAGS.

    o	Usage of R SHLIB now is R SHLIB [-o libname] files, where the
	file names can be that of source or object files.

    o   A new R CMD interface allows invokation of executables in
	$RHOME/{etc,cmd} without installing them or setting paths.

    o	Data files are now also documented using the Rd format, all
	data documentation in the base package has been converted
	accordingly. Rd files for data have a \keyword{datasets} as
	identifier.

    o	new function mahalanobis() for Mahalanobis distance

    o	quantile.default() now handles Inf's correctly.

    o	New command line options `--enable-blas' and `--enable-readline'
	to configure.

    o	pretty(x) is more reasonable when max(x)-min(x) < 1e-10 max(|x|),
	and has a new argument "shrink.sml" for that case.

    o	formatC(.) supports a new "fg" format for flexible
	non-exponential formatting.

    o	etc/build-htmlpkglist has been integrated into etc/build-help
	(option --htmllists)

    o	family	gaussian(.) and inverse.gaussian(.) both accept several
	link arguments [J.Lindsey].

    o	The graphics function "tck" now produces effects just
	like those in S (e.g. par(tck=1) now produces grid lines).
	Since using "tck" produces nasty results in some circumstances
	there is also an alternative parameter "tcl" which defines
	the tick length in terms of lines of text.  The default
	setting is par(tcl=-0.5).

    o	menu() now takes additional arguments `graphics' (currently
	unused) and `title'.

    o	New function plot.formula().
	plot.factor() now produces boxplots when given 2 arguments.

    o	New function write.table().

    o	signif() now has a `digits' default of 6.

    o	Old-style long command line options (`-save' etc) changed to
	GNU-style (`--save' etc).
	Debugging options (`-ddd', `-gdb', `-xxgdb') unified into the
	new `--debugger' (`-d').
	New command line options `--version' (`-V') and `--help' (`-h')
	which print useful information and exit.

    o	The loading of profiles at startup now works as follows.
	Unless the new `--no-site-file' was given, a site profile is
	sought (as specified via the environment variable `RPROFILE',
	or if this is unset defaulting to `${RHOME}/etc/Rprofile'.
	Then, unless the new `--no-init-file' was given, the user
	profiles (`.Rprofile' and `~/.Rprofile') are sought.

    o	New functions subset() and transform() intended primarily to
	make life with dataframes easier.

    o	debian directory has been added so Debian GNU/Linux packages can be
	created from raw source.

    o	The graphics system has been through a major overhaul.
	It is now possible to have multiple active device drivers
	and to control them with full suite of dev.xxx() functions
	available in S.	 Display lists are now kept for interactive
	devices.  When an on-screen graphics window is resized,
	the content of that window is redrawn at the new size.
	At present only X11 and PostScript graphics device drivers
	are available, but more are on the way.

    o	On systems using IEEE arithmetic, the builtin Inf and NaN
	values are now recognised and used.  NA and NaN should
	propagate correctly in computations, with NA dominating
	in computations involving both quantities.
	E.g. NA+NaN is NA.

    o	Some of the t, F, and chisq distribution/probability functions
	now allow a noncentrality parameter `ncp'.

    o	Functions ptukey() and qtukey() provide the distribution and
	quantile functions for the maximum of several studentized
	ranges.

    o	system.file()  [now documented] returns all files matched by
	wildcards.

    o	data() now supports more file formats: .RData for binary
	files, .txt or .tab for data to be read by
	`read.table(file, header=TRUE)' and .csv for data to be read
	by `read.table(file, header=TRUE, sep=";")'

    o	Rdconv: new tabular environment, new sections `\format' and
	`\source', new output format `-type Sd' for S documentation

    o	.First.lib() now implemented; called by library() after loading
	a package.

    o	print.summary.[g]lm() now give `significance stars' and a symbolic
	correlation matrix.

    o	new is.R() function.

    o	glm() now also returns an AIC value [from JL].
	print..glm methods indicate the options()$contrasts in some cases.
	In summary.glm(..., correlation=..), the default has been changed to
	corr. = FALSE  which is consistent with	 summary.lm().
	predict() now works again for glm objects.

    o	the `flag' argument in formatC(.) can now have more than one
	character.

    o	nlm() returns the number of iterations used [from J.Lindsey].

    o	cut, diff, hist, mean, quantile, seq, trunc()  are now all generic.
	cut() has an `include.lowest' argument as S.

    o	save.image() as short-cut to save the current session in .RData.

    o	new design of HTML help pages, including an index of all
	functions from all installed packages.

    o	new editor function pico()

    o	matrices and arrays can have zero extents

BUG FIXES (many of which resulted from the added features...)

    o	atanh(.) now works

    o   summary(glm) and summary(lm) now use compatible names.

    o   [pq]tukey(.) now working.

    o	title() now handles main=, sub=, xlab=, ylab= with embedded
	newlines correctly.  This is partly a change in title and
	partly a change in the underlying graphics code.

    o	min(.), max(.), sum(.)	now return integer for integer arguments.

    o	which(.) now returns integer.

    o	Rd files: leading whitespace of lines in user-defined sections
	was not correctly removed by Rdconv

    o	sign(.) works again.

    o	[.data.frame segfaulted if arg. wasn't a data frame

    o	"R --no-readline" now again gives proper prompts.

    o	demos/zero.R  dyn.load(.) now should be working more easily.

    o	mode(.) now returns "(" for a "parentheses 'call'".

    o	Bug fix in mva dist.c for method binary (gave "invalid
	distance"). plot.hclust failed for data without row names.

    o	R INSTALL should work (again) now when `pkg' is a relative file
	name.

    o	.not.yet.implemented() now takes an arbitrary number of args.

    o	Plotting of dendrograms is working again.

    o	data.frame(.) now uses "1:n" as default row.names.

    o	image(.) and contour(.) now also work called as, e.g., ``image(z)''.

    o	the first argument of axis(.) is now called `side' as in S.

    o	format(NULL) now works.

    o	minor fix in symnum.

    o	hist() now is more compatible to S, has a new `labels' argument,
	and should work ok for non-equidistant breaks.

    o	plot(-1) now labels properly.

    o	Many small code changes (eliminating extraneous variables, nested comm.)
	in C code in order to satisfy `gcc -Wall' [Doug Bates].

    o	model.extract() will now extract arbitrary model frame arguments.


    o	list of currently loaded libraries (.Dyn.libs) not saved
	from session to session (really, this time)

    o	rhyper works with vectorisation, degenerate cases.

    o   printing of objects in lists now dispatches methods correctly

You didn't expect us to be THAT patient, did you?!

Some comments (compiling on S.u.S.E. Linux 5.1):

1. I like to compile in a side-room, /depot/R-0.62 as it happens.
   My intended ultimate destination was /usr/local/R-0.62. After setting
   prefix, "./configure", "make", and "make install", it wouldn't run properly.

   Despite trying every obvious config option, the "R" script had insisted
   on setting RHOME as the directory it was compiled from: /depot/R-0.62/R-0.62/

   It took some time to suss out that this needed to be edited to read
   RHOME=/usr/local/R-0.62/lib/R

   After this was done, it seems fine. The above is NOT obvious from the INSTALL
   document.

2. The "help" browser seems to be hard-wired to be netscape. This can of course
   be changed by editing the function "help.start" in
   /usr/local/R-0.62/lib/R/library/base/R
   but the knock-on effects are not obvious.

   a) I don't have netscape on the machine I run R on;
   b) In any case, with KDE on this machine, I like to use the program
      /opt/kde/bin/kdehelp
      as HTML browser: it's attractive-looking, slim (199428 bytes!) and fast.

   I'd welcome informed advice on how to change this function without breaking
   anything else that depends on it, and on any consequential changes that may
   be needed.

That's it for now. More later, possibly ... !

With thanks, and best wishes to all,
Ted.

Message-ID: <x2sol7r4nl.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


Due to a glitch with the CVS version management software (quite likely
my own fault), R-0.62.0 got shipped without the "tests" directory.
Apart from preventing "make tests" from working, it also has untoward
consequences for "make clean" and the like.

So there's an updated version in R-0.62.1.tgz in the usual places.

For good measure, there's also a patch file.

Subject: Literal "&" in help index
In-Reply-To: <x2ra0sujs9.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>
Message-ID: <XFMail.980615011606.Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk>

Hi Folks,

The file .../lib/R/library/base/html/00Index.html (the contents list of the R
base package help) contains the lines:

<TR><TD width=25%><A HREF="Logic.html">&</A></TD>
<TD>Logical Operators</TD></TR>
<TR><TD width=25%><A HREF="Logic.html">&&</A></TD>
<TD>Logical Operators</TD></TR>

These cause my neat little "kdehelp" browser to segfault when clicking on an
HREF from this file (though netscape seems robust to it). This is because "&"
is an escape for "special characters" in HTML, and the problem is cured if each
"&" is replaced by the HTML escape code for a literal "&", namely "&amp;", so
that the lines become

<TR><TD width=25%><A HREF="Logic.html">&amp;</A></TD>
<TD>Logical Operators</TD></TR>
<TR><TD width=25%><A HREF="Logic.html">&amp;&amp;</A></TD>
<TD>Logical Operators</TD></TR>

For those of you contemplating using something other than netscape, the above
change may be worth noting, in case you encounter the same problem.

It is probably worth "officially" making this change anyway, for the sake of
"pure" HTML.

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

Subject: New Package bindata at CRAN
Message-ID: <13702.11255.28465.291926@galadriel.ci.tuwien.ac.at>


I have put the new package bindata to CRAN, which provides a method
for creating binary (i.e., 0-1-valued) random variables with
correlation structures by converting multivariate random variables to
binary variables.

The package includes a postscript file of a technical report
describing the method, here's the abstract:

**********************************************************
The generation of random variates from multivariate binary
distributions has not gained as much interest in the literature as,
e.g., multivariate normal or Poisson distributions. Binary variables
are important in many types of applications. Our main interest is in
the segmentation of marketing data, where data come from customer
questionnaires with ``yes/no'' questions. Artificial data provide a
valuable tool for the analysis of segmentation tools, because data
with known structure can be constructed to mimic situations from the
real world (Dolnicar et al. 1998). Questionnaire data can be highly
correlated, when several questions covering the same field are likely
to be answered similarly by a subject. In this paper we present a
computationally fast method to simulate multivariate binary
distributions with a given correlation structure. The implementation
of the algorithm in R, an implementation of the S statistical
language, is described in the appendix.

The following are now on CRAN:

KernSmooth:  version 2.2 of the code for Wand & Jones book on kernel smoothing.
logspline:   spline fits to log denisites, with automatic choice of smoothing.
ppr:         projection pursuit regression.
rpart:       recursive partitioning (CART-like)
VR:          Venables & Ripley libraries 5.3pl021 for 0.62.1

and in the devel section

tree:        a clone of tree, prune.tree, cv.tree ...

which is fully operational but not much documented. Use your V&R2!

You can find out about KernSmooth, logspline, ppr and rpart in the
on-line statistics complements to Venables & Ripley at

    http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS2

The final release of the VR libraries is yet to come: it will follow
the bug-fixes in 0.62.2. If you really want to experiment, the current
version will be at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R, but do use this with
the latest R-release.tar.gz or R-snapshot.tar.gz.

Subject: DSE package
Message-ID: <98Jun25.152447edt.13441@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

There is now an "alpha" version of my DSE time series library available at
<http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/pgilbert>. The main changes between this and
the version in the development area of CRAN  are for installing under R 0.62.1.
There are also a few bug fixes.

I have so far only tested on Solaris, but hope to test on Linux in the next few
days. If anyone installs the package and runs the tests on other operating
systems, I would appreciate having reports. I will submit the new version to
CRAN once I am relatively sure everything is working fairly well on other
platforms.

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Fri Jul 10 14:35:41 1998
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 10 Jul 1998 14:35:41 +0200
Subject: R-0.62.2 is released
Message-ID: <x2hg0pzxwi.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I have just put R-0.62.2.tgz and R-0.62.1-0.62.2.diff.gz into the FTP
area at Auckland. As usual, do not fetch it from there unless
absolutely urgent, because of the NZ Internet billing system. The
files should get mirrored to the main CRAN site in Vienna tonight and
the rest of CRAN within days.

[This time I seem to have managed to get the release out on the same
date for all core team members -- the Auckland time stamps say "Jul 10
23:59"...]

This is a patch release, mainly fixing bugs, but we have also let some
new features slip in this time.

Here's the top of the CHANGES file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.2

(The new functions predict.glm, poly, aov, alias, biplot.default and
biplot.princop, update.default and rug all come from Brian D. Ripley,
who is also responsible for finding and/or fixing a lot of the bugs)

NEW FEATURES

    o   predict.glm() added.

    o   text() is generic.

    o   update.default() (replaces update.glm() and update.lm()).
        (This will only work if you comment out update.lm and
	update.glm in the sources, or disable them with
	update.lm<-function(object,...)NextMethod(), etc.)

    o	predict.lm() changed towards S-plus compatibility. Intervals are
	still available via interval= argument.

    o	zapsmall() function.

    o	polygon() now handles NAs

    o	options(show.signif.stars = TRUE).  If FALSE,
	summary.lm and similar functions do *not* print significance stars
	anymore.

    o	poly() for [g]lm modelling.

    o	aov()	for Analysis Of Variance [anova].

    o	alias() for displaying ``aliased'' factor levels in (>=2)way anova.

    o	mva: Now has  biplot and biplot.princomp

    o	rug() plot.

    o	new  src/library/profile/Common.R   for	 OS-independent intialization.

    o   new date stamp mechanism (ensures that prerelease versions carry
        correct date)

BUG FIXES

    o   abbreviate() now always retains the first letter. 

    o   attr() partial matches for attribute name.

    o   axis() accepts graphical parameters.

    o   binomial() accepts factor responses.

    o   cbind() works with data frames. 

    o   contrasts() gives simpler labels (like S) for factors with
        two levels.

    o   contrasts<-() now has a how.many= argument.

    o   contour() and image() can accept a list to specify the matrix.

    o   contr.poly() uses orthogonal polynomials (like S) not raw
        polynomials.

    o   data() could fail with a partial match to the dataset name.

    o   density() works correctly if from= or to= are used.
            n= can now take any value, not just a large power of 2.

    o   expand.grid() now accepts more than two arguments, 
        or a list of factors.

    o   factor() and ordered() handle their levels argument better.

    o   family.glm() now returns the correct family (including link etc).

    o   legend() now knows about lwd.

    o   match.args() works correctly for default arguments.

    o   model.frame.lm() did not invoke `lm'.

    o   model.matrix() calls model.frame() if needed.

    o   model.response() now returns names, so glm() gives names to
        residuals, fitted values, etc.

    o   quasi() works in glm() (was missing aic component).

    o   seq() sometimes omitted the final value due to rounding error.

    o   terms.formula() and update.formula() now resolve `.' in formulae
        and tidy up `(a + b) - b' etc.
    
    o   ... is now passed down correctly to functions inside functions.

    o   save.image didn't work (Martyn Plummer)

    o   abs() instead of fabs() in seq.c crashed R on Digital Unix

    o   model.matrix() gagged on variables with complicated names 

    o   saturated models acting up in glm

    o   various improvement of build procedures

    o   rbind(NULL, matrix) core dump

    o	density() default 'bw' now 0.9*(...) instead of 1.06*(...)
				[=Silverman's rule of thumb].

    o	detach(2) now works.

    o	format() doesn't drop names anymore.

    o	format.pval() works with NAs.

    o	print.[summary.][g]lm() functions print numbers better formatted.

    o	legend() now also works properly in  log coordinates.

    o	backsolve() now working;  bakslv.c not depending on
	Fortran_underscores.

    o	Tick marks acting up on log axes in postscript (fix from Martyn Plummer)

    o	The Rd format has a new section \details{} (needed for proper
	Sd2Rd translation). \R was not understood for nroff
	conversions, longer dashes (-- and --- in latex syntax) are
	now converted properly.

    o	prompt.default() now carries "\details{}".

    o	R [ SHLIB | COMPILE ] were broken on some Solaris systems
	due to use of bash syntax. R [ INSTALL | COMPILE | SHLIB ]
	now use a MAKE environment variable if present.
	R INSTALL only rebuilds man pages if they are not already
	up to date.

Subject: V&R libraries, tree for 0.62.2, R Complements for V&R
Message-ID: <199807201606.RAA18031@toucan.stats.ox.ac.uk>

Versions of the V&R libraries, VR_5.3pl025-1.tar.gz, and of
tree_0.2-2.tar.gz (giving most of the functionality of S's tree system
including all that I have ever used) are now available on CRAN's Vienna
node, and will propagate.

There is an early draft of an R user's complements on Venables & Ripley
available from

http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS2/Compl.shtml

This is unlikely to be completed until 0.62.3 or perhaps 0.63 is
released.

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Sun Aug 16 19:59:32 1998

Subject: Bug tracking system
Message-ID: <x2yasoajuj.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>


I'm happy to announce that there is now a real bug tracking system for
R.

Hopefully, this will make it easier for us to keep track of unresolved
bugs, which has been difficult because of the massive amount of email
that we receive.

The system, which is of the JitterBug variety is available through the
web at

http://r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk

or via email to

r-bugs at biostat.ku.dk (which is aliased to r-bugs at stat.math.ethz.ch for
the absent-minded...)

There are no particular formatting requirements for reports, although
the web interface tries to help you remember to give information on
your R version, OS, etc.

The web interface also allows you to browse through old reports to see
whether your problem has already been reported by someone else.

The members of the core team are automatically notified when new
reports come in. You will not necessarily receive any response to a
bug report, other than perhaps that the next version of R will have
one bug less.

Note that this is intended to help us get rid of bugs in R, not as a
general helpdesk service. For problems in using and installing R, the
mailing lists should still be preferred.

The HTML version of the R-help mailing list archives has been moved
slightly.  The new address is 

http://www.ens.gu.edu.au/robertk/R/help/98b/index.htm 

for the present section and

http://www.ens.gu.edu.au/robertk/R/

is a page containing links to all the sections.

The move has taken place because they have been expanded to include
r-devel and r-announce archives as well.  (at present these archives only
contain from August 1998 onwards, but I will also convert the earlier
archives).

Subject: R-0.62.3 is released
Message-ID: <x2btp55oan.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>

I have just put R-0.62.3.tgz and R-0.62.2-0.62.3.diff.gz into the FTP
area at Auckland. As usual, do not fetch it from there unless
absolutely urgent, because of the NZ Internet billing system. The
files should get mirrored to the main CRAN site in Vienna tonight and
the rest of CRAN within days.

[And, may I add, the NZ connection is slower than a sloth in a tarpit.
I had turnaround times of up to at least 15s while packaging the
release!]

This is a patch release, mainly fixing bugs, but with a few new
features too.

Most likely, this will be the last of the 0.62 series, 0.63 is getting
pretty stable now.

Here's the top of the CHANGES file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.3

NEW FEATURES

    o   preserve factor levels and contrast settings in model objects

    o   factor[...,drop=T] reduces level set

    o   added dblepr, intpr

    o   do_modelmatrix(model.c): Set rownames from data argument.

    o   New generic function preplot().

    o	A new R BATCH interface for non-interactive execution.

    o   Added `offline' argument to help() for producing hardcopy via
	latex and dvips.

    o   glm.fit.null now calculates AIC and print.glm.null prints it

    o   effects.lm implemented

    o   new class "mlm" for multivariate "lm", predict.mlm to go with it

BUG FIXES

    o   biplot[.default]() was redundant in "base" package; now only in "mva".

    o	unix(..) now helps the user to find  system(..) instead.

    o   apropos("[") and methods("[") now both work (even though "[" is not
	a valid regular expression).

    o   row.names<-.default now exists. Converts object to data
        frame and then adds row names

    o	codes() now distinguishes between ordered and unordered factors

    o	codes() had *opposite* semantics of Splus. Now it's the same.

    o   replicating factors now yields factors (again)

    o   print.summary.xxx  functions more consistent, using new function
	print.coefmat().

    o   Changed many `T' to `TRUE'  and  `F' to `FALSE' in the base package.

    o   binary operation on 1x1 matrix lost dimension

    o   fix anova.glm for null model

    o   glm.fit.null: ensure df.residual == df.null for a null model

    o   summary.glm: correlations in saturated cases

    o   stat.anova: use match.arg and labeled switch statement

    o   Major cleanup of glm iteration code

    o   Correct reordering of glm coefficients if pivoting

    o   Rownames on contrast matrices

    o   factor() and [.factor preserves class "ordered"

    o   Code rearrangement in predict.lm (avoid unnecessary computation)
        + let rownames through on predictions

    o   model.matrix.default: Initial code to define model frame
        simplified considerably after defaulting data argument to
        sys.frame(sys.parent()).  This also removes the problem where
        data.frame mangles I(x^2) and similar names, so that the
        "reorder" sanity check at the end fails.

    o	The handling of extra FORTRAN libraries (f2c-related and BLAS)
	should now be correct.  Via SHLIBLDFLAGS, add-ons will also be
	linked against these libraries.

    o	The handling of extra FORTRAN libraries (f2c-related and BLAS)
	should now be correct.  Via SHLIBLDFLAGS, add-ons will also be
	linked against these libraries.

    o   Modified makefiles so configure followed by "make distclean"
        should restore the source tree to its original form.

    o   a leftover "colours <- colors" caused trouble when collating
	sequence changes caused files to go into the "base" file in a 
	different order

From guido at sirio.stat.unipd.it  Wed Sep 16 14:01:52 1998
From: guido at sirio.stat.unipd.it (Guido Masarotto)
Date: Wed, 16 Sep 1998 13:01:52 +0100
Subject: A new version of R-0.62.3 for Win3.1/Win32s, Win95 and WinNT 
Message-ID: <19980916130152.A227@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

I have just made available on ftp://sirio.stat.unipd.it/pub/R a
new version of R for MsWindows compiled with gcc-mingw32.
Enclosed you can find the README. Since there are many news
(with respect to my previous port, rw0613), please read it.
guido


------------------------ README ----------------------------------------
rw0623b.zip is  a binary distribution of R (based on the last "stable"
version, 0.62.3) for Win3.1/Win32s, Win95 and WinNT. 
rw0623s.zip contains the  sources.

A. News (with respect to rw0613)
--------------------------------
(a) I rewrote the console using a portable toolkit (GraphApp, see
http://www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~loki/graphapp). Now, output is buffered
until some input is required. This means that it is faster 
(for a good test, I learned it from Peter Daalgard,
try `ls("package:base")' ). Of course, buffering can be disabled
(you need to disable it ONLY if your command require a lot of time
and you want to look to the output line by line). In addition,
there are some command history support. For a mini help on the new
console, use the help/Console menuitem.

(b) I also rewrote the graphics device using GraphApp. Apart for the redraw
(which seems faster) the GraphApp device is +/- equal to the one that
you find in RJune. With respect to rw0613 the major improvements are:
(i) it is a R0.62.x device,i.e., it supports multiple instances,
resizing, copy,...(look to the dev.xxx functions); (ii) it supports 
plotting math expression; (iii) there is  a new item in the 
menu which let to save the contents of the active device as a gif file;
(ii) arbitrary line patterns in any width are supported.

(c) Now, edit makes use of an external editor (the default one is
notepad),i.e., it works as under Unix. 

(d) date() now works. In addition, proc.time(), and so system.time(..),
works (but don't expect too much, you will get only the elapsed time).

(e) IEEE math (Inf, Nan,..).

(f) I used the GNU regex library (included in rw0623s). Hence all the
code is GPL'ed.


B. The new menubar
------------------
The menu bar contains the following item:
 File       Source R Code  -> ask for a filename and then send to the
                              interpreter a source(filename) command.
            Load Image     -> ask for a filename and then send to the
                              interpreter a load(filename) command.
            Save Image     -> ask for a filename and then send to the
                              interpreter a save.image(filename) command.
 Edit       Copy          
            Paste
	    Copy and Paste
	    Select All
	  
 Misc       Kill current computation
            List objects          -> send to the interpreter a ls() command
	    Remove all objects    -> ask for confirmation and then send to
	                           the interpreter a rm(list=ls()) command
 Graphics   save as Postscript    -> ask for a filename and then send to the
                                     interpreter a dev.print(...) command
            save as gif           -> ask for a filename (extension must be
	                             .gif) and then save the current plot
				     as gif
 Help       Console               -> mini help on the console
            R language            -> ask for a topic and then send to the
	                             interpreter a help(topic) command
            Apropos               -> ask for a topic and then send to the
	                             interpreter a apropos(topic) command
            About      
	    
Observe that some of the menu items just send to the interpreter a
command. This means that these items are disabled when the interpreter is
waiting for the completation of a previous command,i..e, when you
have the ''continuation'' prompt. On the other end, under normal editing 
(prompt='>'), since the current line is saved and then restored you can,
for example, type part of a command, ask for some help, and then
complete your command.

C. Printing
-----------
To avoid questions: printing is not directly supported (yet).

To print the content of the console you must:
a) select the text;
b) copy it to the clipboard;
c) paste it in some word processor or editor which can print.

To obtain a good copy of your  graphs you can:
a) save it as postscript and then print on a ps printer (or play with
it using gostscript);
b) save it as a gif and then print it using one of the many programs
which support this format (image manipulation programs, word processors,
internet browsers,...).

If you give the focus to a graphic windows, you can also copy it
to the clipboard using the alt+print keys. But this is the standard
Windows command and you will get also the window's decoration.
So this is useful only to get a "draft" copy of the graph.
[however, I find quite effective to open a word processor
in which to paste command, console output and graphs. Indeed this is the way,
I ask my students to work (of course, they must also write comments!)].


D. Installation (binary distribution)
-------------------------------------
Just unzip the archive. You will get a new directory (rw0623).
The executable is bin/R.exe. 

Observe that since I consider this 
version more experimental than rw0613 (see below), the binary
distribution contains only the standard packages (base,eda,mva
and stepfun). If this version will prove to be useful enough,
I will try to provide binaries for some of the other packages.
[Note: I tried to load in the new executable some of the
dll included in rw0613 and I didn't have any problems.
So, if you want, you can experiment.]

For the same reason, I have included only the standard help files 
(not the html ones; if we want, you can download them from CRAN).

E. Installation (sources)
-------------------------
(a) Preparation
First of all, you have to download and untar the complete sources.
Then, in the directory R-0.62.3, unzip rw0623s.zip.
You will get a new directory (src/gnuwin32) which includes:
1) the windows/graphapp source +
2) a modified version of the GraphApp library (the Windows 2.40 version
+ the console + some functions to rotate bitmaps and text + some
functions to draw patterned lines in any width) +
3) the GNU regex library.

(b) Compilers
I have tested the following compiler:
(a) native compilation using egcs1.02-mingw32;
(b) native compilation using egcs1.1-mingw32;
(c) cross compilation (from a Linux box) using gcc2.8.1+Binutils2.9.1+
    g77-0.5.23 using the 1 July version of mingw32.
The binary distribution has been cross-compiled.

(c) Native compilation
To rebuild the system using egcs-mingw32 go to the src/gnuwin32
directory and type 
> make
This will build the main executable (in R-0.62.3/bin) and
the standard packages: base, eda, mva, stepfun.


(d) Cross-compilation
You should edit the definitions in the file MkRules to reflect your
system. As an example, the file that I use under Linux is provided as
MkRules.cross in rw0623s.zip.

F. Installing other packages
----------------------------
Uncompress the package you want in R-0.62.3/src/library.
Then, from the gnuwin32 directory, 
> make -f MakePkg -C ../library/xxx PKG=xxx [SRC=src] [DLLNAME=yyy]
will try to build the package xxx.
The SRC=xxx option must be used if the source is in another
directory (e.g. if it is in src-c, use SRC=src-c).
The option DLLNAME=yyy must be used if the package requires a
dll with a name different from xxx.dll. For example, the dll
of integrate is adapt.dll.
If you don't need the two flags, you can use the short command
> make pkg-xxx
Special compiler flags must be setted in MakeDll. Look to this file
for some example.
There are no support for generating the help files.
You have to download the pre-formatted one by any CRAN site or
to build them yourself on a Unix machine.

G. Tools
--------
To rebuild the system and to install other packages, you need
not only a compiler but also some Gnu tools. The ones that I used,
coming from DJGPP, are  in djtools.zip.
You must uncompress this file from C:. It will expand
under usr/bin and usr/home.
To use the tools usr/bin must be in the PATH.
In djtools.zip, a version of bash is included.
I am not sure that you need it but I did all my work 
using it. To use bash, the environmental variable HOME
should point to /usr/home. You have to start bash, from Program Manager,
Start Menu or in a MsDos windows, with
> bash -login
If you install djtools.zip, please use the make in usr/bin not
the one of your compiler.


H. Bugs (known) and misc. observations.
---------------------------------------
(a) As always, the English of this README.
(b) de() doesn't work anymore. If someone needs it, I can try to include
the old one (or try to write a portable version of it using GraphApp).
(c) edit(...) doesn't work properly under Win3.1/Win32s.
(d) system(...) is quite limited (popen under MsWindows is
a nigthmare).
(d) To use this version under Win32s you need a recent version
of Win32s (I have only tested with the last one that can be 
found at ftp://ftp.microsoft.com).
(e) Only the mouse can be used to select the text in the console.

I. Future
---------
This is an experimental release. Since, both the console and the graphic
device are new, I suspect that it is less stable of rw0613.
Until now, it has been rather funny to rewrite the console and the
graphic device. However, the future will depends on the reactions.
If someone think that this version can be useful I (we) can try
to fix the bugs and to improve it. So, I am waiting for comments.
Some obvious and not difficult things to add are:
a) xdr support so that the binary images can be exchanged between
Unix and Windows;
b) use of the keyboard to select text;
c) printing (perhaps not so easy) and support for copying
the graphic window to the clipboard (easy).
d) ....................................................
In addition, since GraphApp is available also under X11, if someone
is interested, I can provide a version of this port for Unix. Indeed,
I develop the console and the graphic device under Linux.

When I try to run rw0632/bin/R.exe from the binary distribution on our
WinNT3.51 systems the following happens:

A "R Console" window appears with a menu bar. After a few seconds, the
window disappears. No messages are written in the Console window.

This happens for me on these platforms:

A) WinNT 3.51 US Workstation with SP5
B) Citrix Winframe 1.6 SP5A 

P.S. I experience the same with rw0613.

Subject: R-0.62.4 is out
Message-ID: <x2btn3o21t.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>

As usual, it is available from the Auckland repository as of a few
minutes ago, but it is preferred if you wait until it trickles out
into your nearby CRAN site in a couple of days.

Yes, I know I said there wouldn't be any more 0.62's, but there's
still some way to go before 0.63 and it turned out that at least some
of the bugs could be fixed for the release version fairly easily.

There are still quite a few bugs (mainly memory handling ones) that
are fixed only in the development version, but unfortunately some new
ones have been added too. We're trying to get a stable version of 0.63
out in a couple of weeks.

Subject: R-0.62.4 for MSWindows 
Message-ID: <19981106092322.A31433@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

Following the release of R-0.62.4, I have update my Win32's port.

New features:
 - The console can be configured (font, colours, dimensions). 
  No fancy dialog (yet), but look to the rw0624/etc/Rconsole file.
 - help.start() now is implemented. Of course, you need the html 
  documentation.
    
Bugs fixed (I hope):
 - Alt+Gr problems on some European keyboards.
 - Focus is 'always' given back to the console.
 - Filters in the dialogs which ask a file-name.
 - round(..) now works as documented.
 - Some small modification to the graphic device (position of
   text and clipping of lines was sometimes not exact). In addition,
   I changed the font to helvetica (for better consistency
   with the X11 device).
	  
New Files:
 - rw0624b.zip : binary distribution (unzip somewhere; the
   executable is in rw624/bin); 
 - rw0624s.zip : source;
  - rw0624html.zip : documentation in html form; unzip inside rw0624;
		                   no name mangling -> don't use with Win3.1+Win32s.

From: bates at stat.wisc.edu (Douglas Bates)
Date: 10 Nov 1998 11:13:10 -0600
Subject: Debian GNU/Linux package of R-0.62.4
Message-ID: <6rpvavzd21.fsf@verdi.stat.wisc.edu>

I have created a Debian Linux package from R-0.62.4 and uploaded it to
the master Debian archive.  It will be incorporated in the 2.1 (or
"slink") release of Debian GNU/Linux.  This release is currently
frozen (i.e. bug-fixes only are allowed in uploads).  The scheduled
release date is December 15, 1998.  We'll see if we can actually make
the scheduled release date on this release :-).

The package is called r-base_0.62.4-1.  It can be installed on a
Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 system as it does not use any 2.1-specific
facilities.  It is currently available as
http://cran.stat.wisc.edu/bin/linux/debian/2.0/r-base_0.62.4-1_i386.deb
and should propagate to other CRAN sites within two days.

The source package is available at the usual Debian sites such as
      ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/slink/main/source/math/

P.S. If you wonder why the release is called "slink", the releases of
Debian GNU/Linux are named after characters in the movie "Toy Story".
The 2.2 release is named "potato" :-(.  I tried to get them to change
it to "potatoe" to inject some American political humor but they
refused.

Subject: R-0.63 is released
Message-ID: <x2k90ztrus.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've put up R-0.63.0.tgz up for FTP from Auckland some minutes ago.
As usual, don't get it from there unless you are desperate, but wait
for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who *are* desperate, I've left a copy in
	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.63.tgz 
(Be gentle, that's my desktop PC!)

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.63

NEW FEATURES

    o	library(... , warn.conflicts = TRUE)
	now prints all conflicts arising from attaching the given package.

    o	new  .Platform	variable  for better modularizing
	platform dependence. __This_is_"beta"_and_bound_to_be_changed___

    o	new arguments to colnames(..) and 
	rownames(x, do.NULL = TRUE, prefix = "row").
			   _
    o	par(bty = "]") for _| box(.) in plots.

    o	New standard package `modreg' (smoothing and local MODern
	REGression methods) contributed by B. D. Ripley.

    o	par() has a `no.readonly = FALSE' argument which allows more
	sensible  op <- par(no.readonly = TRUE);  on.exit(par(op)).

    o	Real Bessel functions of 1st to 3rd kind, of arbitrary order:
	besselI(), besselK(), besselJ(), besselY() are the I(), K(),
	J(), and Y() Bessel functions.

    o	New conflicts() function from B.D.Ripley

    o	uniroot has a new `maxiter' argument and returns #{iter} and
	precision.

    o	New option `show.coef.Pvalue' (default: TRUE).	If FALSE,
	print.summary.[g]lm does not print P values.

    o	New `R --vanilla' is equivalent to
	  R --no-save --no-restore --no-site-file --no-init-file

    o	gc() has now a `verbose' argument and returns a matrix with free
	and total n- and v-cells(heap).

    o	New example(<foo>) function runs the \emph{Examples} R code of
	<foo>.	example() calls source() which now has a `verbose'
	instead of `debug' argument.

    o	experimental functions [as.|is.|]pairlist() for the few old-style
	dotted pair lists [undocumented].

    o	options(check.bounds = TRUE) makes sub-assignments which
	"stretch" a vector give a warning [dropped undocumented
	check.bounds() function].

    o	Makefiles should now conform (mostly) with the GNU Coding
	Standards.  In particular, `make install', `make uninstall'
	and `make install-strip' now work.
	Also, it is now possible to build R in a non-source directory.

    o	which() preserves names and has a new `arr.ind' argument
	allowing for array indices.

    o	New functions {d,p,q,r}signrank for the Wilcoxon signed rank
	distribution, and {d,p,q,r}wilcox for the Wilcoxon (rank sum)
	distribution.

    o	Command line options GNUified a bit further.
	New command line option `--verbose' for printing more
	information about progress.
	Command line options `--vsize' and `--hsize' as replacements
	for `-v' and `-n' which are now deprecated.
	Added `--silent' as synonym for `--quiet'.
	Short-style option `-V' obsolete.

    o	Added bug.report() to generate & send bug reports from
	within R.

    o	The PostScript device driver now uses the ISO Latin1 font
	encoding.  This should allow Western Europeans to render
	their languages correctly.  It is likely that additional
	encodings will be added (e.g. Latin2) when we figure out
	how to set the correct font encoding in printers.

    o	The mathematical annotation code has been reworked.  Italic
	correction works better.  Additional functionality will be
	added.

    o	"sample" now has an optional "prob" argument which gives the
	probabilities of sampling each element in the vector being
	sampled.  The present implementation is based on some code
	from E. S. Venkatraman <venkat at biosta.mskcc.org>.

    o	The internal data structure used to represent lists has
	changed from being based on dotted pairs to generic vectors.
	Users should see no changes as a result (with the exception
	of some efficiency gains in list operations).

    o	Subscripting matches that of S more closely.  It is now
	possible to use subscripting beyond that the end of vectors
	and lists.

    o	Element labelling in "c" and "unlist" should match that of
	of S.

    o	Added split.screen etc functions for manipulating multiple
	screens on a single device

    o	After help.start() the HTML help system is used for all help()
	requests. The name of the browser is now controlled by
	options("browser").

    o	Added kmeans to package mva (donated by B. Ripley)

    o	New persp function added.  It is NOT compatible with S (yet)
	and is subject to internal and interface changes.

    o	gctorture() for torturing the garbage collector to reveal
	memory protection bugs. (Call GC on every memory allocation). 

    o	B. Ripley's aov code (and more) has been added. This includes: 

	- aov() now handles models with Error terms, multiple
	  responses. 

	- proj(), model.tables(), se.contrast(), replications(),
	  eff.aovlist() are implemented for aov fits, and where
	  appropriate for lm fits.

	- dummy.coef(), with methods for lm and aovlist fits.

	- add1(), drop1(), step() for stepwise fitting of statistical
	  models, with default, lm and glm methods.

	- summary() and deviance() -- mlm methods.

	- kappa()  for estimating condition numbers) 

	- labels() to find a suitable set of labels from an object

	- C() for setting the contrasts of a factor

	- anova(), plot(), summary() and deviance() methods for mlm fits

    o	eval() semantics changed when envir= is a list. A 3rd argument is 
	now allowed, specifying the enclosure (i.e. where R looks for
	variables *not* found in envir=) it defaults to the calling 
	environment (was .GlobalEnv). Note that when used inside a function,
	it is often desirable to set the enclosure to the parent 
	environment instead. [ eval(e, data, sys.frame(sys.parent())) ] 


BUG FIXES

    o	min(NULL); max(double())  now give warnings.  range() gives NA.

    o	substring("", NULL) no longer segfaults.

    o	formatC(.) now takes default "width = 1" when both width and digits
	are unspecified.

    o	several fixes in internal axis and tickmarks setup for
	"extreme" ranges and values, especially for "log" scaling.

    o	seq(a,a, by=b) now works properly.

    o	print.data.frame(.) now calls print.matrix instead of print(.)
	which finally enables the 'right = TRUE' argument.

    o	R --help  gives more

    o	postscript() now uses 'hyphen' instead of 'plusminus' for a minus.

    o	source(..., echo=TRUE) now puts a `"' if necessary after truncation.

    o	Changes to the PostScript device driver mean that the volume
	of output has been reduced to about a third of what it was.

    o	Fixes and restructuring to name generation in connection with
	unlist() and c().

    o	Many bugs found and fixed in the memory allocation / garbage
	collection area. In particular, the parser was sometimes
	UNPROTECT()ing the wrong pointers.

    o	lm(y[g=="1"]~x[g=="1"]) caused memory corruption

Subject: VR and tree libraries for 0.63
Message-ID: <199811161807.SAA07147@toucan.stats.ox.ac.uk>

These are now at CRAN (at least in Vienna).

Please note that VR_5.3pl030-1.tar.gz really does need 0.63: there
are problems with 0.62.x and 0.63 reading .rda files written by the
other. The earlier VR_5.3pl027-1.tar.gz for 0.62.3/4 remains on CRAN
in directory Old/0.62.

tree_0.3-1 adds tree.screens and tile.tree (needs 0.63), and support
for formulae like  use ~ . - estperf - names.

Subject: R-0.63 for MsWindows
Message-ID: <19981120133135.A16976@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

New files (at CRAN/binaries/ms-windows/win-32-devel ; available
at least at Vienna; in a couple of days on every mirrors)

- rw0630b.zip: binary distribution; it should run under Win3.1/Win32,
               Win95, Win98 and WinNT; 
- rw0630h.zip: `stardard help' files (the ones you see after
	       help(topic) or ?topic); it also includes 
               the help examples (the one needed by the new
               function example(topic)); 
- rw0630w.zip: documentation in html format (usable but far from 
               perfect; files taken from my Unix box; no name-mangling ->
	       don't use under Win3.1).
- rw0630s.zip: source.


Changes (with respect to rw0624)
--------------------------------
- Minor adjustment to reflect changes in R-0.63.0
  (options, example,...)
- Fixed a couple of minor bugs in the graphics device.  
- More control keys (some Emacs like (crtl+a, crtl+e, crtl+k),
  and, on popular demand, crtl+c and crtl-v for copy and paste);
  take a look at the help/console menuitem.
- Added support for Cygwin B20 (target remains Mingw32,i.e, 
  no Unix emulation layer)
- Access of global variables in R.exe from a dll should work
  (all the orrible name-mangling needed by `gnuwin32' -
   `var' in R.exe becames `*__imp_var' in a dll - is done
   automatically).

In-Reply-To: <19981120133135.A16976@sirio.stat.unipd.it>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.981123171844.20286G-100000@loach.bio.indiana.edu>


Using Martin Plummer's source rpms, I have started putting together binary
rpms for linuxppc.

The current rpms are:
	R-base-0.63-3.ppc.rpm
	R-VR-5.3pl030-1.ppc.rpm
	R-contrib-1998.11.20-1.ppc.rpm

These are (or will be) found at:
	1)  CRAN/bin/linux/linuxppc/
	2)  ftp://biocserver.cwru.edu/pub/linuxppc/
		(science apps for linuxppc ftp site)
	3)  ftp://ftp.linuxppc.org/pub/linuxppc/linuxppc-R4/contrib/RPMS/
		(and its mirrors)

I hope these are useful to someone else.

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Fri Dec  4 15:22:23 1998
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 04 Dec 1998 15:22:23 +0100
Subject: R-0.63.1 is released
Message-ID: <x21zmgoulc.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've put up R-0.63.1.tgz up for FTP from Auckland some minutes ago.
As usual, don't get it from there unless you are desperate, but wait
for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who *are* desperate, I've left a copy in
	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.63.1.tgz 
(Be gentle, that's my desktop PC!)

The person who fetched R-0.63 *from New Zealand* last time might
prefer ftp.stat.auckland.ac.nz, though...

There's also a version split in two for floppies and a patch file if
you prefer that.

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.63.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   new function mosaicplot().

    o	xy.coords(.) has a  "recycle = FALSE" argument,	 used in text().

    o	RNGtype() allows to choose different Random Number Generators.
		__EXPERIMENTAL__

    o	print.default(.) now also works with a `right = TRUE' argument.
	{{ print.matrix(.) is bound to become deprecated... }}

    o	new help page `Memory' on the usage of command line options
	--vsize and --nsize. Error message if R runs out of memory
	points to help(Memory).

    o	rowsum() and improved na.omit() added from survival4
    
    o	backsolve(.) has new arguments "upper.tri = TRUE,  transpose = FALSE"

    o	hist() has new "right = TRUE" argument;	 
	"right = FALSE" gives  [a,b) intervals

    o	help() has "htmlhelp" argument, allowing to suppress htmlhelp after
	help.start().  This is desired for ESS.

    o   quantile(.) has an "names = TRUE" argument for speed.
	It is much better documented now.


BUG FIXES

    o	build-help --dosnames should now also work for text help,
	latex and examples.

    o	seq() should work better now (fuzz-factor 1e-7 inserted)

    o	multiple arguments to return caused value to be a pairlist

    o	data.frame choked on long names from deparse()

    o	data.edit now works (dataedit doesn't need pairlist()s anymore)

    o	as.pairlist(NULL) is ok

    o	ts(1:5, start=2, end=4) now work.  Further plot(ts(..), ts(..))

    o	eigen() returns $vectors in any case [S compat].

    o	apply(cbind(1,1:9, 2, quantile) doesn't drop quantile names anymore

    o	array(1, dim=(1:3)[c(F,F,F)]) is now valid == array(1,NULL) == c(1);
	the same for array(a,d, list())

    o	fix problem with step() and offsets

    o	drop attributes on matrix subsetting

    o	kappa(.) now works [dtrco now in load table (ROUTINES)].

    o	pmin() and pmax() now preserve attributes.

    o	handle null models arising in drop1(), step, etc.

    o	partial matching problem with $ indexing

    o	matplot(.) works with lwd (vectors)

    o	par("cex.axis") now has the desired effect...

    o	which(.) now omits NAs in its argument.

    o	rbind.data.frame caused character-to-factor coercion a bit too often

    o	couple of messups in dotplot

    o	z[[1]] <- ~x probl fixed as suggested by J.Lindsey 

    o   do_modelframe could lose contrast attributes

    o	"make check" needed standardisation of locale

    o	unlist(...,recursive=F) got names wrong

From guido at sirio.stat.unipd.it  Mon Dec 21 13:14:43 1998
From: guido at sirio.stat.unipd.it (Guido Masarotto)
Date: Mon, 21 Dec 1998 13:14:43 +0100
Subject: R 0.63.1 for Windows
Message-ID: <19981221131443.A8032@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

A new version of R for Windows is available from CRAN in directory
bin/windows/windows-NT. This supersedes rw0630, rw63-io, bdr0631 and earlier
versions.  It runs on Windows 95, 98, NT4 (on i386), at least.

There are two executables, Rgui.exe and Rterm.exe.

NEW FEATURES

  Will run from NT command line.

  No `tricks' are needed for animated graphics.

  The windows are much more responsive.

  R commands can be interrupted by Esc.

  Rterm allows batch mode operation and can also be run in 
  inferior-R-mode under NTEmacs.

  There is a history mechanism for graphics plots.
  
  Graphics can be copied to the clipboard.

  Commands history is saved between session (only by Rgui.exe).
  
  Saved images and user profile are called .RData and .Rprofile as under Unix
  (before they were RData and Rprofile).

PACKAGES:

Pre-compiled packages for this (and hopefully all subsequent versions)
are available at CRAN/bin/windows-NT/contrib.
