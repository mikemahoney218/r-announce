The HTML Mailing List Archives at

	www.R-project.org

should now get online updates, i.e., each mail is integrated into the
archives directly after it has been sent to the list. Hence, searching
in the subjects of mails can easily be done using your web browser's
search function.

A more powerful search engine (which also searches the bodies of the
emails) will hopefully be added soon.

Best,

Hi,

the new version 1.1-0 of package e1071 is now on CRAN.

Changes:
*) use libsvm 2.1 for support vector machines. We are now also a kind
of ``official'' R frontend to libsvm and linked from their homepage at
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm
*) new functions for comparing partitions

Thanks to Peter Dalgaard, Kurt Hornik and Achim Zeileis there is now a
new version (1.1-2) of package multiv on CRAN which passes R CMD
check. All examples have been modified to use data sets available in R
and a bug in a call to Fortran has been fixed. The remaining changes
are mostly cosmetics.

Subject: HYDRA Java library for Markov
 	Chain Monte Carlo.
Message-ID: <3A57FC6D.7E444C3A@warnes.net>



Announcing the first release of the HYDRA Java library for Markov
Chain Monte Carlo.

HYDRA is an open-source, platform-neutral library for performing
Markov Chain Monte Carlo. It implements the logic of standard MCMC
samplers within a framework designed to be easy to use and to extend
while allowing integration with other software tools.

HYDRA provides methods for implementing MCMC samplers using
Metropolis, Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs methods. In addition, it
provides classes implementing several unique adaptive and multiple
chain/parallel MCMC methods.  It was developed as part of my
Ph.D. thesis work at the University of Washington.

The Hydra package is available from:

 http://www.warnes.net/Hydra

My thesis, which describes one of the adaptive MCMC algorithms and
gives an tutorial on constructing MCMC samplers using the HYDRA
library is available at

 http://www.warnes.net/MCMC

Subject: R 1.2.1 is released
Message-ID: <x2puhp2i1l.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've rolled up R-1.2.1.tgz a moment ago. This is mainly a bugfix
and minor tweaks release, although some new features (notably factor
analysis) has sneaked in.  

You can get it from

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.2.1.tgz 

or

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.2.1.tgz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

There's also a version split in three for floppies and a patch file
against 1.2.0.

	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.

Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	New functions factanal(), varimax(), promax() and examples in
	package mva.

    o	New functions readBin() and writeBin() to transfer binary data
	to and from connections.

    o	merge() is partially moved to C to reduce its memory usage.

    o	library(help = PKG) now displays the contents of the package's
	DESCRIPTION file in addition to its INDEX.

    o	Sd2Rd can handle S4-style documentation too: see `Writing R
	Extensions'.

    o	prompt() now also works with a character argument (useful for
	producing many *.Rd files in a loop).

    o	The Unix front-end shell script now ignores a value for R_HOME
	found in the environment.

    o	Connections functions such as file() now accept a description of
	length > 1, with a warning.

    o	All text-mode connections now accept input with LF, CR or CRLF
	line endings.  This means that readLines() can be used on DOS
	files and source() on Mac files, for example.

	Also, CRLF-terminated files can be used as stdin on Unix, and
	files with last lines without an EOL mark can be used as stdin
	and source()-ed on Unix and Windows.

    o	DESCRIPTION file has a new recommended `Maintainer:' field.

    o	stars() now uses a larger "cex" for the labels, and cex and lwd
	are now arguments. Further, the argument names (xlim, ylim,
	axes) are now consistent with other plot functions.  The key symbol
	is not clipped anymore into the plot region by default.

    o	Date-time quantities are now printed with the timezone, if known.

    o	R CMD build now ignores all files specified (via Perl regexps)
	in file `.Rbuildignore' in the top-level source	directory of a
	package.

    o	Horizontal boxplots are possible with  horizontal = TRUE.

    o	all.equal() on lists now compares them as generic vectors, that
	is they are equal if have identical names attributes and
	all components are equal.

    o	Invalid lines in .Renviron now give warnings when R is started.

    o	Argument `na.last' implemented for rank().


BUG FIXES

    o   There have been many small improvements/corrections in the
	documentation. In particular:

	The help pages for lm and glm now describe the fitted objects.

	is.vector() is now correctly documented: complex vectors and
	lists return TRUE.

    o   The default sortedXyData constructor in the nls package now
        handles missing values in the response.

    o	On startup, file .RData is now restored *after* the site and
	user profiles are loaded (if at all).  This is as previously
	documented.

    o	as.POSIXlt (and *ct) operating on a character string
	only extracted the date (and not the time) in some cases.

    o	as.POSIXct() on character objects was ignoring `tz'.

    o	codoc(ignore.generic.functions = TRUE) works again.

    o	Explicitly close files opened by sink() for OSes (such as
	Windows) that benefit from it.

    o	Prevent closing the sink connection (which would be a silly
	thing to do).

    o	showConnections(all = TRUE) was sometimes counting connections
	incorrectly, and so not showing some closed ones.

    o	ts(1:10, start= c(1999,6), end = c(2000,3), frequency = 12)
	now prints both years (as it should).

    o	Monthly multivariate time series now print proper month names
	in all cases.

    o	print.stl(), print.princomp() and print.prcomp() now pass on
	`digits =' etc.

    o	prompt() now produces a \usage{} line for data frames and
	other datasets, as documented in `Writing R Extensions'.

    o	glm() now returns correct linear predictor and fitted values
	for zero-weight cases.

    o	scan(strip.white=TRUE) and readline() could give incorrect
	answers when an input field was empty or blank.

    o	dchisq() now behaves better for large values of its ncp parameter.

    o	besselJ(*, nu) is now ok for nu < 1; fix improves accuracy of
	other values by a few bits as well.

    o	The convergence criterion in the Fortran SVD code has been
	changed to circumvent spurious convergence errors when
	comparing extended-precision quantities on ix86 Linux (and
	some compilers and options).

    o	Rdindex now handles multi-line \title{}'s correctly.

    o	Add weights.glm() so that plot.lm() gets the correct weights from
	glm objects (the ones that go with deviance residuals not the
	working residuals).

    o	Printing a language object (e.g. a formula) in a list was
	clobbering the buffer holding the tag labels which then were
	lost in subsequent lines of printout (PR#746).

    o	aic in family() objects is now computed more precisely using
	dxxxx(log=TRUE).  For binomial fits the value was wrong for
	models specified via proportions and weights (PR#796).

	Avoid NaN values in aic where n = 0 occurs.

    o	Using non-integer numbers of successes in a binomial glm (as
	formerly in demo(lm.glm)) now gives a warning, as the theory and
	in particular the AIC value is not applicable.

    o	demo(is.things) works again {is.ALL() doesn't call methods
	anymore}.

    o	persp(*, nticks = nn) now works (better) for too small nn.
	persp(*, main = t1, sub= t2) now work (as always documented).

    o	Printing of attributes of a list element no longer precedes
	`attr' by the tag (PR#715).

    o	It is no longer possible to use df[foo] to select non-existent
	columns in df and so create an invalid object of class
	"data.frame" (PR#698).

    o	edit.data.frame() was trying to set row.names on a list, which
	is no longer allowed.

    o	In the \link[pkg]{topic}, `pkg' was not being used if `topic'
	was found in a package in .lib.loc.  Now `pkg' is always used.

    o	plot() with small relative ranges gave an error, which e.g. broke
	library(ts); plot(stl(ts(rep(1:7, 15), freq = 7), s.win = "per"))

    o	Using scan() with a 0-length `what' argument now gives an error
	message rather than a segfault.

    o	Loading .Random.seed could extremely rarely and with some
	generators reject a value as NA_INTEGER when it was valid.

    o   save(..., ascii=TRUE) created broken files when saving strings
        containing special characters (ASCII code > 127).

    o	mean(c(1,NA,NA,NA)[-1], trim = .1, na.rm = TRUE) doesn't give an
	error anymore.

    o	As the supplied afm files are not properly in the ISOLatin1
	encoding, the font metric for "-" was wrong since 0.63 on a
	postscript/xfig device, and randomly wrong in 1.2.0.  It will
	now be correct (but the files remain incorrect: C45 is "minus"
	not "hyphen" and there are missing slots).

	Metrics for the duplicated characters (acute, dieresis,
	macron, space) in ISOLatin1 encoding are now correct for both
	occurrences: previously only one was present.

    o	The data-time functions try harder to guess the DST setting
	when the OS does not know, as some OSes were printing times
	in DST if this was marked as unknown.

    o	Setting par(pty=) after par(pin=) or par(plt=) was having no
	effect until the margins were set.

    o	Nested \describe sections in .Rd files have (again) nested
	indentation when converted to text.

    o	Concatenation of C strings by ## is no longer used, to avoid
	spurious warnings from some recent versions of gcc.

    o	dev.copy2eps() allows a `paper' argument to be passed to
	postscript().

    o	file.show() handles the case of zero files better.

    o	formula.lm uses object$formula if it exists, in preference 
	to object$terms.

    o	strsplit() is corrected for an empty split pattern.

    o	kronecker() now does a better job when creating dimnames.

    o	Better handling of input dimnames in fourfoldplot().

Anyone using the penalised partial likelihood routines in survival5 should
update their version. 

A bug has been fixed in the S package: in coxph() models with penalised
likelihood and strata it was possible in some circumstances to get an
infinite loop or perhaps an incorrect answer. 

The new version (2.3) is on cran.r-project.org and will percolate through
CRAN in the next few days.

Subject: R 1.2.1 for Windows
Message-ID: <20010119085923.07174@hal.stat.unipd.it>


Windows binaries at CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org)  have been updated 
to R-1.2.1.  See below for the list of Windows-specific changes.

guido masarotto
(for the R-core team)


		Windows-specific changes to R
		=============================

Pipe connections now work under RGui and embedded R.dll, although
slower than under Rterm, and as they run with no stdin or stdout to
inherit what you can do with them is limited.  They work better for
reading than writing.

The installer will no longer crash trying to install addons with a
long PATH and R_HOME not set.  Similarly, Rcmd accepts long paths.

Using Rcmd INSTALL with an incorrect path specification ending in \ no
longer runs amok.

Internal pager no longer fails when given a file of one line and no
line ending.

Hyperlinks to other packages in CHTML files launched by help() will
now work irrespective of the working directory (but like HTML, only
to packages in the same library).  The .chm files do need to be
re-built under this version.

help(, winhelp=TRUE) will now find alias topics as well as main items.

Hitting the total memory allocation limit set by --max-mem-size will
give a warning (and will usually also lead to an error, and that may
suppress printing out the warning).

There is a new make target test-Reg to run the regression tests (which
now do I/0, so might give different results on Windows).

Rcmd build with the latest tar.exe will exclude files as intended.

There are further improvements in the GUI console receiving output
(e.g. from tcltk interactive functions) during input.  If you can,
arrange to send output in a single piece, or at least a whole line at
a time (although partial lines will now work).  For example, don't use
print() but capture the output in a text connection and use something
like cat(paste(outlines, "", collapse="\n)) to output a single string.

The initial rescaling is no longer done for windows(rescale="fixed"),
and the scrollbars in that mode are more responsive but move the
viewport 20 pixels at a time.

Macintosh binaries and sources have been updated to R-1.2.1

You can find them at

			http://www.eco-dip.unimi.it/R

Please remember that this is still at a developer stage. Feedback and 
interactions with other Macintosh developer is warmly welcome.

			Macintosh-specific changes to R
			===============================

* help.start() has been implemented. Now R for MacOS calls the 
standard HTML browser to visualize the HTML help and manuals.

* getenv() in now working. The .Renviron file is assumed to be in 
"etc" directory. Directory "etc" is assumed to contain the history 
file, the image session and the environments variables

* a command line has been added. It is possible to specify options as 
in the Unix/Win implementations. If you don't want to specify 
options, simply type return after starting R aplication.

* InfoZip code has been included in this version. Help files are now 
stored in zipped archive to save disk space.

* packages have been recompiled and few other bugs fixed

We are pleased to announce the first volume of R News, the
newsletter of the R project for statistical computing. The newsletter
is available online as PDF file at

	http://cran.R-project.org/doc/Rnews

and will propagate to the CRAN mirrors within the next days.

R News will feature short to medium length articles covering topics
that might be of interest to users or developers of R, including

* Changes in R: new features of the latest release 
* Changes on CRAN: new add-on packages, manuals, binary distributions,
  mirrors, ... 
* Add-on packages: short introductions to or reviews of R extension packages 
* Programmer's Niche: nifty hints for programming in R (or S) 
* Applications: Examples of analyzing data with R 

The newsletter as a medium for communication intends to fill the gap
between the R mailing lists and scientific journals: Compared with
emails it is more persistent, one can cite articles in the newsletter
and because the newsletter is edited it has better quality control. On
the other hand, when compared to scientific journals, it is faster,
less formal, and last but not least focused on R.

As all of R, R News is a volunteer project. The editorial board
currently consists of the R core development team plus Bill
Venables.

We really hope you will enjoy reading R News!

For the editorial board,
Fritz Leisch

CRAN now contains a new package for numerically solving ordinary
differential equations.  The package (odesolve_0.5-3) currently provides an
interface to the solver "LSODA" written by Linda Petzold and Alan
Hindmarsh.  LSODA is an adaptive solver, switching between methods
appropriate for non-stiff and stiff systems as the problem requires.  In
this implementation, the system of ODEs are written as an R function.  A
vector of parameters may be passed to the function, making it relatively
easy to use lsoda in functions to be passed to various R optimizers.

From p.dalgaard at pubhealth.ku.dk  Mon Feb 26 14:33:08 2001
From: p.dalgaard at pubhealth.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)

Subject: R-1.2.2 is released
Message-ID: <x2lmqttvqj.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-1.2.2.tgz a moment ago. This is mainly a release to
add Stefano's Macintosh sources, but there are also a couple of
bugfixes and minor tweaks.

You can get it from

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.2.2.tgz 

or

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.2.2.tgz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

There's also a version split in three for floppies and a patch file
against 1.2.1.

	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.

Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.2


NEW FEATURES

    o	The Macintosh port becomes a full member of the R family and its
	sources are incorporated as from this release.	
	See `src/macintosh/INSTALL' for how that port is built.

    o	The API header files and export files `R.exp' are released under
	LGPL rather than GPL to allow dynamically loaded code to be
	distributed under licences other than GPL.

    o	postscript() and xfig() devices now make use of genuine Adobe
	afm files, and warn if characters are used in string width or
	height calculations that are not in the afm files.

    o	Configure now uses a much expanded search list for finding a
	FORTRAN 77 compiler, and no longer disallows wrapper scripts for
	this compiler.

    o	New Rd markup \method{GENERIC}{CLASS} for indicating the usage
	of methods.

    o	print.ftable() and write.ftable() now have a `digits' argument.

    o	undoc() has a new `lib.loc' argument, and its first argument is
	now called `package'.


BUG FIXES

    o	The behaviour of polygon() with NA coordinate values is now
	documented.

    o	polygon() now correctly recycles the values of border and lty.
	Thanks to Denis White.

    o	readBin() and writeBin() were not always making good use of
	long types (such as long double) when available.

    o	The C function fprec was not handling very small denormalized
	numbers correctly.  This affected the way they were printed on
	Windows, for example.

    o	legend() now draws points after lines allowing "empty dots on
	lines" thanks to Ben Bolker.

    o	Setting row/column names preserves the names of the dimnames
	(PR#809). 

    o	Using help() after help.start() on Unix was failing to find
	the linked help files if more than one package was loaded (as
	now happens by default).

    o	scan now sets the maximal sizes internally when `what' is a list
	from `nmax' and failing that `nlines'.	This uses memory much
	more efficiently if `nmax' is specified.  read.table() makes use
	of this.

    o	The FORTRAN code used is now much closer to ANSI compliance.

    o	cov.rob() gives a useful error message on nearly-degenerate
	matrices.

    o	summary() on a data frame was computing results to a precision
	based on options("digits") (default 4), not its `digits'
	argument.  Now results are computed to full precision but 
	formatted using `digits'.

    o	summary(m, digits=*) also properly works for matrices.

    o	When returning parameters from .C/.Fortran, the OBJECT field was
	not copied even though class attributes were (PR#834).

    o	There was a spurious warning from the X11 driver on 100 dpi
	displays (PR#840, fix from Tom Vogels).

    o	scan() was reading all-blank numeric fields as zero. 
	Should be read as NA, and are now. 

    o	dnbinom(*, size, *) now works again for size < 1 (PR#842).

    o	dgeom(*, p = 0) and pgeom(*, p = 0) don't give NaN anymore.

    o	smooth.spline() allows zero weights again.

    o	aperm() fix for list arg; aperm(*, resize=FALSE) now works with
	dimnames (by dropping them).

    o	The xfig() driver was not closing unclosed polygons as the R
	driver expected (but did not document).

    o	spec.ar() now handles order 1 correctly.

    o	Add fuzz to prevent anomalies with hist().

    o	print.matrix() checks length of rowlab, collab (PR#850)

    o	add1.glm() was using the wrong weights for binomial glms in
	cbind(successes, failures) ~ lhs  form, since 1.2.0.

    o	Eliminate packing of the `structRstart' structure, which was
	probably non-ISO C and caused some compilers problems (PR#852).

    o	all.vars() no longer returns empty `names' (PR#829).

    o	dotplot() passes `cex' down to the mtext() calls used for the
	labels (PR#816).

    o	The pictex() driver was drawing polylines incorrectly (PR#845).

    o	In the event of a fatal X11 error (this can be generated under FVWM
	by selecting Destroy), the input handler would loop, leaving the
	"please save work and shut down R" advice useless. There should now
	be an opportunity for a relatively graceful exit.  

    o	polyroot() misbehaved if all coefficients except that of the highest
	degree term were zero (partial fix for PR#751)

    o	spline(method="natural") was extrapolating incorrectly (both
	to the left and to the right, for different reasons).  (PR#653)

    o	Line clipping was incorrect for log-plots. (PR#839)

    o	Add explicit test for rank-deficient residuals to summary.manova().

    o	The help search databases did not contain the data from the
	platform-specific help files.

    o	parse.dcf() and hence package.contents() now work with a warning
	for empty contents' files.

    o	which.min() and which.max() now properly work for 0-length and
	NA-only arguments.

Subject: Introduction to R (S) [in German]
Message-ID: <p05010404b6c57f131b3a@[129.206.113.199]>



Couse notes for a short introduction to the S language have been posted as
  <http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/R/doc/contrib/s.pdf;I>

This is material for a 4-5 days course, assuming some background in 
statistics (German style).

As a matter of fact it is a Trojan horse, claiming it is teaching the 
S language, but under the shelf it is trying to convey some ideas 
about statistics.

For those of you who are going to Vienna it is a chance to train your German.

Comments and corrections are welcome (please mail to me directly).

Subject: VR_6.2-4 is released
Message-ID: <200103021825.SAA29994@toucan.stats.ox.ac.uk>


An update of the VR bundle was released on Monday and should have
propagated around CRAN now.  It is a collection of bug fixes (many to
documentation, thanks to Kurt Hornik's great tools undoc and codoc) and
small enhancements for R.

It does need R 1.2.2 to install (the help files make use of new markup
for methods) but only 1.2.0 to run.  Thus the precompiled Windows
version will run on rw1021.

Subject: Binaries of R 1.2.2 for Ms Windows at CRAN
Message-ID: <20010305092235.11089@hal.stat.unipd.it>


Windows binaries at CRAN (bin/windows/Windows-NT/base) have been updated 
to R-1.2.2.  See below for a list of Windows-specific changes.

(for the R-core team)


		=============================
		Windows-specific changes to R
		=============================

The long-running saga of importing R metafiles into Word is over;
lines are now visible in screen previews in Word.  It was necessary to
use `geometric' rather than `cosmetic' pens to achieve scalable line
widths in metafiles: Word was failing to show lines drawn with
`cosmetic' pens.

bringToTop() now works with MDI child windows as well as SDI windows.

Rcmd build/check use a different check for a directory, to work around
a bug in (some versions of) Windows Perl.

The datetime code has been modified to work around a problem reported
on a Win98 machine which caused times to be reported in GMT.  (This
seems a bug in a particular version of msvcrt.dll and few machines
were affected.)  A side-effect of the changes is that the timezone
names reported are usually more sensible (but sometimes less).

File etc/Makeconf-tests was missing from rw102Xsp.zip.

Rcmd SHLIB now supports compilation from C++ sources.

Rterm now saves and resets the console window title.

On Win2k, system(intern=TRUE) was failing to reset stderr to the console.

Subject: MacOS X (Darwin) version of R-1.2.2
Message-ID: <200103220226.SAA57875@pine.frazmtn.com>


a version of R-1.2.2 for MacOS X (more precisely, for Darwin 1.3 with
X11R6) is at

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R-1.2.2-MacOSX.tar.gz

the file should be 5161540 bytes

-- su root
-- unpack in /

and everything gets put in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib

this has the standard packages, including tcltk, and it has
X11R6 support

it uses tcl/tk 8.0 from the GRASS distribution

i also have a version with gnome support, but it still needs
some work -- and it's probably nonsense anyway

of course you need to install an X server and an X browser

i have not tried this in the Public Beta, so some of you may have
to wait a couple of days

there were no big problems in porting, but of course you need
Darwin versions of X11R6, of tcl/tk, and a shim for dlopen (that
maps the usual calls to Mach-O dyld calls). because of dyld
you have to replace "-shared" when linking foo.so to
"-bundle -undefined suppress".

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R/R-1.2.2.MacOSX.tar.gz

This is not a Classic or Carbon or Cocoa application, you need to
run it from the command line and you need to have an X11 server
running. It only uses the classical Unix part of Mac OS X, i.e. it
is similar in functionality to the Linux and OSF ports.

I would like (somewhat belatedly) to announce that Steffano Iacus
has joined the R-core group, and will oversee the Macintosh port(s)
for R.  Steffano has done a stirling job of bringing the of Mac
port into line with the other ports.

Well done Steffano, and welcome aboard!

New MacOS X (Darwin with X11R6) builds are at

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R

These include some dylibs that were missing from previous
builds. One is of R-1.2.2 (patched), the other of R-devel
(with many add-on libraries included).

You do need some version of X11 (I use Xtools, they tell me
Xfree also works) installed.

If something does not work for you, drop me an email.

We are pleased to announce that the proceedings of the

  2nd International Workshop on Distributed Statistical Computing
  March 15-17, 2001, Technische Universit?t Wien, Vienna, Austria

are now available online at

  http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/Conferences/DSC.html


Citing Thomas Lumley's conference summary:

``DSC 2001: Cooperation between programs (and programmers)

  There were about 30 presentations over the three days of the
  conference, with speakers from universities, industrial research
  groups, and software companies in twelve countries. Despite the
  programmed sessions' running about 30% over time there was lively
  discussion over coffee and lunch and in during the conference's social
  program.

  DSC 2001 emphasized the value of high quality open source software as
  a statistical research platform but also for the ultimate goal of
  delivering modern statistical methods to those with little knowledge
  of (or interest in) statistical computing.''

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Thu Apr 26 14:37:25 2001
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 26 Apr 2001 14:37:25 +0200
Subject: R-1.2.3 is released
Message-ID: <x2ae53rg56.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-1.2.3.tgz a moment ago. This is mainly adds fixes to
the Macintosh port, but it also has a number of bugfixes for all
versions.

You can get it from the developer site

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.2.3.tgz 

or

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.2.3.tgz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.
Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

There's also a version split in three for floppies and a patch file
against 1.2.3.

(The patches miss out on one file because binary files cannot be
patched: R-1.2.3/src/gnuwin32/installer/R.bmp .  This not likely to be
of consequence to anyone, but drop us a note if it bothers you.)


	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.


Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.3

NEW FEATURES

    o	Support for configuration and building the Unix version of R
	under Mac OS X.	 (The `classic' Macintosh port is `Carbonized'
	and also runs under that OS.)

    o	dotchart() and stripchart() become the preferred names for
	dotplot() and stripplot(), respectively.  The old names are now
	deprecated.

    o	Functions in package ctest now consistently use +/-Inf rather
	than NA for one-sided confidence intervals.



BUG FIXES

    o	`Writing R Extensions' incorrectly described an entry point
	`fmod' which was not included in the R binary on most systems.
	The entry point has been removed, to avoid any confusion with
	the standard C entry point of the same name.

    o	Printing of kernels in package ts was unreliable: the internal
	representation was correct.

    o	A problem with "..." in substitutions has been fixed (PR#860).

    o	Various strangeness with match.call() and "..." has been fixed
	(PR#813).

    o	sys.function() could return an unevaluated promise, messing up
	formals() and match.arg() (PR#872)

    o	Deparsing or dumping attributes with non-standard names was
	not quoting the name (PR#871).

    o	We now use match.fun() in tapply() so that it won't get trapped
	by non-functions masking FUN.

    o	The `nmax' argument in scan(what=list(...), nmax=300) was
	counting blank lines, although they were said to be ignored.
	This affected using read.table on files with blank lines in
	1.2.2, and using `n' with `what' a list.

    o	as.numeric(), as.integer(), as.complex() returned zero on
	completely blank strings. Now they return NA. (PR#870)

    o	Overflow in deparse() in terms(formula) with very long left-hand
	side fixed.  (PR#873)

    o	lowess(c(1:3, 7:5)) now should give the same on different platforms,
	since now in the C code (int)(f*n + 1e-7) is used.

    o	curve(*, add = TRUE) now works properly with active log scales.

    o	rt() could give different results on different platforms as
	the order of evaluation of calls to random numbers was not
	fully defined.	This affected the Mac port.

    o	ppr() inside nested calls sometimes failed to find objects
	due to a typo in the eval call in ppr.formula.

    o	qchisq(0.025, 31, ncp=1, lower.tail=FALSE) now works.  (PR#875)
    
    o	dchisq with integer x, df and ncp sometimes gave incorrect
	results on i686 Linux.

    o	Cancelling a quit caused quit() not to ask next time it was called.

    o	Some complicated operations with "..." didn't work.

    o	Missingness was not correctly propagated in some cases.

    o	eigen() segfaulted on 0-dimensional matrices.

    o	nls( ~ rhs, ..)	 now works (formula with empty left hand side).

    o	The fuzz added in hist() for 1.2.2 broke the logic testing for
	equidistant breakpoints.

    o	Calls to replacement functions ("f<-") lost argument names
	(PR#888).

    o	is.na() and is.nan() gave random results on lists containing
	zero-length objects.

    o	cor(), cov() and var() gave a result on a zero-length argument
	(now an error).	 cov(x, NULL) and cor(x, NULL) are now errors
	if x is a vector.  (PR#883).

    o	?smooth.spline now properly describes `spar' which is *not*
	lambda.	 smooth.spline(1:20, spar = 50) gives an error instead
	of silent nonsense.  print.smooth.spline() now makes use of a
	digits argument.

    o	Confidence intervals for wilcox.test() had the samples reversed
	in the two-sided case (PR#895), and sometimes got continuity
	correction wrong (PR#896).

    o	Using out-of-range font values in text() on a postscript()
	device on Windows could crash.	.ps.prolog was incorrectly
	named in some of the documentation.  (PR#914)

    o	Warning messages of > 8191 chars could crash R (PR#902), as
	could errors.  Now they are truncated to 8191 chars on
	machines which have vsnprintf (almost all).

    o	range() now works properly for date-time objects.

    o	contour() could loop infinitely (PR#897).

    o	R-lang manual had precedence of %% wrong (PR#879).

    o	try() constructs lost protection of R_alloc'ed memory (PR#877).

    o	Documented that as.numeric() dispatches to as.double.foo methods
	(PR#918.1).

    o	httpclient() (and the "socket" method of download.file) skipped ^V
	rather than ^Z in input (if drop.ctrl.z = TRUE, the default).
    
    o	boxplot(*, range = 0) and boxplot.stats(*, coef = 0) now
	don't return outliers anymore (PR#917).

    o   segmentation fault with tmp[[1,]] (PR#904)

    o   incorrect "..." handling in plot.factor (PR#830)

Subject: two new packages
Message-ID: <5.0.2.1.2.20010427224918.0193d588@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca>


I've prepared preliminary versions of two packages that I plan eventually 
to contribute to CRAN:

car (for "Companion to Applied Regression") is a package that provides a 
variety of functions in support of linear and generalized linear models, 
including regression diagnostics (e.g., studentized residuals, hat-values, 
Cook's distances, dfbeta, dfbetas, added-variable plots, component+residual 
plots, ceres plots, Durbin-Watson statistics); some tools for graphing and 
exploring data (e.g., enhanced quantile-comparison plots -- with simulated 
envelopes for studentized residuals from linear models, scatterplot, and 
scatterplot-matrix functions); some utilities (e.g., for recoding 
variables); some functions for transformations of data (e.g., multivariate 
unconditional Box-Cox transformation); an enhanced Anova function; and many 
datasets. The object is to make tasks that are commonly employed in 
regression modeling more convenient, particularly for students with limited 
programming skills. I've tried largely to avoid duplicating capabilities in 
existing packages.

sem is a package for fitting "structural-equation models." The package 
supports general structural equation models with latent varibles, fit by 
maximum likelihood assuming multinormality, and single-equation estimation 
for observed-variable models by two-stage least squares.

For the present, I'm making these packages available on my web site, at 
<http://www.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/car/> and 
<http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/sem/>.

I'm particularly interested in suggestions and comments.

John

From stefano.iacus at unimi.it  Sat Apr 28 17:24:55 2001
From: stefano.iacus at unimi.it (Stefano Iacus)
Date: Sat, 28 Apr 2001 17:24:55 +0200
Subject: R 1.2.3 for MacOS/X available
Message-ID: <200104281524.f3SFOYY14401@mail.mclink.it>

 From release 1.2.3, R can run different Macintosh platforms.

Two versions are currently available that are non concurrent.

One version runs on MacOS Systems from 8.6 to 9.1 and MacOSX using the 
standard MacOS/MacOSX interface, that means that is behaves like any 
usual Macintosh application. (This is mantained by Stefano M. Iacus)

The other version is a Darwin/X11 that means a Unix-like version taking 
advantages of the X11 server (to be installed separately) and of the BSD 
kernel of MacOS X. (This version is mantained by Jan de Leeuw).


About the Carbon version
This new version of R fixes may bugs of the previous Macintosh release 
and adopt Apple's Carbon technology to let R run natively under both 
MacOS 8.6 to 9.1 and MacOS X. This means that under MacOS X when you 
double click on the R icon, the System no longer launches the Classic 
Compatibility environment. Under MacOS X the Carbon R take advantages of 
the new Aqua look/interface and memory management.

More informations on this version can be found at:

http://www.eco-dip.unimi.it/R/rmac-FAQ.html

You can download the carbon distribution at:

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos



About the Darwin/X11 version
There are two builds for Mac OS X, more precisely for Darwin/X11, of the 
R-patched and R-devel distributions of 04/14/01.

They were build using the native cc compiler, with help from f2c, 
dlcompat, libjpeg, libpng, libz, OS X versions of tcl/tk., and Tenon's 
Xtools distribution.

The dynamic libraries you need are included, except for the X11 
libraries, which you have to install anyway along with an X11 server.


In order to install one of these builds, su root, move to /, and unpack. 
Everything installs in /usr/local/lib, except for the R driver which 
goes to /usr/local/bin. The R-devel tarball contains most of the 
contributed R packages.


You can find this distribution on Jan's page :

http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R

Subject: R 1.2.3 for Windows available 
Message-ID: <20010429135224.13386@hal.stat.unipd.it>


A Windows binary distribution of R 1.2.3 is available at
         http://sirio.stat.unipd.it/RWin
It will be mirrored at a CRAN site near you in a couple of days.
See below for a list of Windows-specific changes.

(for the R-core team)


		Windows-specific changes to R
		=============================
rw1023
======

Alternative installers based on Inno Setup 2.0.x, either SetupR.exe or
miniR* (which fits on four floppies).

The location of R_HOME and the version can optionally be recorded in
the Registry (and will be used by the DCOM interface).  The Inno Setup
installers register the installation, and unregister on
uninstallation.  rwinst.exe has an option to register.  Program
rw1023\bin\RSetReg.exe will register, and rw1023\bin\RSetReg.exe /U
will unregister.

The windows() device no longer rounds width and height to the nearest inch.

You can override the settings Windows reports for pixels per inch
(sometimes it is seriously adrift).  See ?windows.

File `extract-usage' needed for codoc was missing from rw1022sp.zip.

The default memory limit (as reset by --max-mem-size) is set to at
least 16Mb, to allow R to start on machines with 8Mb of RAM.

link.html.help() has been re-written using connections and so is
several times faster.

Rcmd INSTALL now allows Windows-style paths to a tar file.

rproxy.dll is now built for StatConnector version 0.99: earlier versions
are no longer supported.

A Windows-specific bug in bitmap() which caused output to appear twice
has been fixed.

Rcmd check now stops when package-specific tests fail (not just
reports on the console).

Subject: RExcel, new version
Message-ID: <3AED1B0C.75D0A038@univie.ac.at>


I just uploaded the new version of RExcel to the incoming directory.

Here is part of the ReadMe:

===============================================================================
R-Excel Interface, Version 0.73                                      
01-04-30
===============================================================================

Overview:
---------

  This package contains an Excel Addin to use R from within Microsoft
Excel
  on Microsoft Windows platforms.


Features:
---------

  Data-transfer both from R to the Excel and vice versa, currently
  supporting scalars (booleans, integers, doubles and strings) and
arrays of
  these. 
  R can be called by executing macros "real time", and we also have
  worksheet functions calling R as part of Excels automatic
recalculation.


Bugs/unimplemented features:
----------------------------

  * COM server sometimes dies unexpectedly, then Excel has to be closed
    and restarted.


Archives:
---------

  RExel073.zip   ... Excel Addin and examples

Installation:
-------------

  * Install the latest R release  (>= R 1.2.3)
  * Install the DCOM server for R (>= 0.99.0)
    Installing the R-(D)COM Interface is still a little bit tricky
    (not yet fully automatic), your really have to read 
    the instructions carefully.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0105031952520.7775-100000@matheron.estadi.uv.es>


Hi,

I have relased a new package that can be helpful to the GIS
users: RArcInfo.
This package allows the user to import data from Arc/Info V7.x binary
coverage. There are functions to import data from the basic files: ARC,
PAL, BND, etc. and also from those that store tables.

Besides, there are also two functions to plot arcs and polygons.

The package will only work on Linux, but soon I will make it to work on
Windows.
Please, notice that the package is in an early stage and I need some
feedback from the users to improve it. I have some ideas, but many more
will be welcome.


 Have a nice day,

Subject: new packages:  grid and lattice
Message-ID: <007601c0e23a$9db66210$175dd882@stat.auckland.ac.nz>


Hi

Two new packages have just been uploaded to the _DEVEL_ section on CRAN:


1.  package "grid"

AUTHOR
Paul Murrell

OVERVIEW
This package provides an altenative graphics system for R.

FEATURES
Very flexible layout facilities (viewports, units, layouts)
Component-based design (graphics can be constructed incrementally and
hierarchically)
Basic support for interaction (graphics functions return "objects")
Highly customisable and extensible

BUGS/UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES
No clipping
Only single active device
Viewport rotation very fragile
...


2.  package "lattice"

AUTHOR
Deepayan Sarkar

OVERVIEW
This package provides graphics functionality similar to the Trellis suite in
S-Plus.

FEATURES
Mutipanel plots of one or two variables conditioned on one or more other
variables.
Formula-style specification of conditioning.
Strips atop the panels to indicate levels of the conditioning variables.

BUGS/UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES
The "key" argument.
The "font" argument.


The lattice package uses the graphics system provided by grid so you will
need to download both packages in order to use lattice.  Furthermore, the
packages are most likely to work only with the latest development release of
R.  At the very least they require R 1.2.0 or later.

The packages are in the DEVEL section of CRAN because they are far from
complete and have many bugs and missing features.  However, they should
contain sufficient functionality to be of use to some people.  We are also
very interested in feedback on things that don't work, things that people
don't like, and even things that people do like :)

From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 22 Jun 2001 14:17:25 +0200
Subject: R-1.3.0 is released
Message-ID: <x2n170emju.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've rolled up R-1.3.0.tgz about an hour ago. This is a major upgrade,
with some structural changes and major new features, especially in the
areas of connections, dates, and the ctest package.

As a new item, we also roll up (in a separate file) a set of
recommended packages that are known to work with R-1.3.0. Binary
distributions are expected to include these packages. 

Please note that the former "survival5" package is now named
"survival". If you install over an existing installation, make sure to
"R CMD REMOVE survival5"

You can get it from the developer site

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0.tgz
ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0-recommended.tgz

or

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0.tgz
http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0-recommended.tgz

or wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day
or two. Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

There are also versions split for floppies.

(Are anyone actually using the split-source versions and not capable
of using the "split" command themselves? They do take up a lot of
space, and I had to remove split versions of earlier releases to make
room for the new one.) 


        For the R Core Team,

        Peter D.


Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Changes to connections:

	-  New function url() to read from URLs.  file() will also
	   accept URL specifications, as will all the functions which
	   use it.

	-  file connections can now be opened for both reading and writing.

	-  Anonymous file connections (via file()) are now supported.

	-  New function gzfile() to read from / write to compressed files.

	-  New function fifo() for connections to / from fifos (on Unix).

	-  Text input from file, pipe, fifo, gzfile and url connections
	   can be read with a user-specified encoding.

	-  New functions readChar() and writeChar() to read character
	   strings with known lengths and no terminators, and to write
	   user-specified lengths from strings.

	-  sink() now has a stack of output connections, following S4.

	-  sink() can also be applied to the message stream, to capture
	   error messages to a connection.  Use carefully!

	-  seek() has a new `origin' argument.

	-  New function truncate() to truncate a connection open for
	   writing at the current position.

	-  Socket connections via function socketConnection().

	-  The `blocking' argument for file, fifo  and socket connections
	   is now operational.

    o	Changes to date/time classes and functions:

	-  Date/time objects now all inherit from class "POSIXt".

	-  New function difftime() and corresponding class for date/time
	   differences, and a round() method.

	-  Subtraction and logical comparison of objects from different
	   date/time classes is now supported.	NB: the format for the
	   difference of two objects of the same date/time class has
	   changed, but only for objects generated by this version, not
	   those generated by earlier ones.

	-  Methods for cut(), seq(), round() and trunc() for date/time
	   classes.

	-  Convenience generic functions weekdays(), months(), quarters()
	   and julian() with methods for "POSIXt" objects.

    o	Coercion from real to integer now gives NA for out-of-range
	values, rather than the most extreme integer of the same sign.

    o	The Ansari-Bradley, Bartlett, Fligner-Killeen, Friedman,
	Kruskal-Wallis, Mood, Quade, t, and Wilcoxon tests as well as
	var.test() in package ctest now have formula interfaces.

    o	Matrix multiplication functions %*% and crossprod() now use a
	level-3 BLAS routine dgemm.  When R is linked with the ATLAS
	or other enhanced BLAS libraries this can be substantially
	faster than the previous code.

    o	New functions La.eigen() and La.svd() for eigenvector and
	singular value decompositions, based on LAPACK.	 These are
	preferred to eigen() and svd() for new projects and can make
	use of enhanced BLAS routines such as ATLAS.  They are
	used in cancor(), cmdscale(), factanal() and princomp()
	and this may lead to sign reversals in some of the output of
	those functions.

    o	Provided the Fortran compiler can handle COMPLEX*16, the
	following routines now handle complex arguments, based on
	LAPACK code.

	qr, qr.coef, qr.solve, qr.qy, qr.qty, solve.default, svd, La.svd.



    o	aperm() uses strides in the internal C code and so is
	substantially faster (by Jonathan Rougier).

    o	The four bessel[IJKY](x,nu) functions are now defined for nu < 0.

    o	[dpqr]nbinom also accept an alternative parametrization via the
	mean and the dispersion parameter (thanks to Ben Bolker).

    o	Generalised "birthday paradox" functions [pq]birthday.

    o	boxplot() and bxp() have a new argument `at'

    o	New function capabilities() to report optional capabilities
	such as jpeg, png, tcltk, gzfile and url support.

    o	New function checkFF() for checking foreign function calls.

    o	New function col2rgb() for color conversion of names, hex, or
	integer.

    o	coplot() has a new argument `bar.bg' (color of conditioning bars),
	gives nicer plots when the conditioners are factors, and allows
	factors for x and y (treated almost as if unclass()ed) using new
	argument `axlabels'.  [original ideas by Thomas Baummann]

    o	`hessian' argument added to deriv() and its methods.  A new function
	deriv3() provides identical capabilities to deriv() except that
	`hessian' is TRUE by default.
	deriv(*, *, func = TRUE) for convenience.

    o	New dev.interactive() function, useful for setting defaults for
	par(ask=*) in multifigure plots.

    o	dist() in package mva can now handle missing values, and
	zeroes in the Canberra distance.

    o	The default method for download.file() (and functions which use
	it such as update.packages()) is now "internal", and uses code
	compiled into R.

    o	eigen() tests for symmetry with a numerical tolerance.

    o	New function formatDL() for formatting description lists.

    o	New argument `nsmall' to format.default(), for S-PLUS
	compatibility (and used in various packages).

    o	?/help() now advertises help.search() if it fails to find a topic.

    o	image() is now a generic function.

    o	New function integrate() with S-compatible call.

    o	New function is.unsorted() the C version of which also speeds up
	.Internal(sort()) for sorted input.

    o	is.loaded() accepts an argument PACKAGE to search within
	a specific DLL/shared library.

    o	Exact p-values are available for the two-sided two-sample
	Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

    o	lm() now passes `...' to the low level functions for regression
	fitting.

    o	Generic functions logLik() and AIC() moved from packages nls
	and nlme to base, as well as their *.lm methods.

    o	New components in .Machine give the sizes of long, long long and
	long double C types (or 0 if they do not exist).

    o	merge.data.frame() has new arguments, `all[.xy]' and `suffixes',
	for S compatibility.

    o	model.frame() now calls na.action with the terms attribute set
	on the data frame (needed to distiguish the response, for
	example).

    o	New generic functions naresid(), napredict() and naprint()
	(formerly in packages survival5 and MASS, also used in rpart).
	Also na.exclude(), a variant on na.omit() that is handled
	differently by naresid() and napredict().

	The default, lm and glm methods for fitted, residuals, predict
	and weights make use of these.

    o	New function oneway.test() in package ctest for testing for
	equal means in a one-way layout, assuming normality but not
	necessarily equal variances.

    o	options(error) accepts a function, as an alternative to
	an expression.	(The Blue Book only allows a function; current
	S-PLUS a function or an expression.)

    o	outer() has a speed-up in the default case of a matrix outer
	product (by Jonathan Rougier).

    o	package.skeleton() helps with creating new packages.

    o	New pdf() graphics driver.

    o	persp() is now a generic function.

    o	plot.acf() makes better use of white space for `nser > 2', has
	new optional arguments and uses a much better layout when more
	than one page of plots is produced.

    o	plot.mts() has a new argument `panel' providing the same
	functionality as in coplot().

    o	postscript() allows user-specified encoding, with encoding files
	supplied for Windows, Mac, Unicode and various others, and with
	an appropriate platform-specific default.

    o	print.htest() can now handle test names that are longer than
	one line.

    o	prompt() improved for data sets, particularly non-dataframes.

    o	qqnorm() is now a generic function.

    o	read.fwf() has a new argument `n' for specifying the number of
	records (lines) read in.

    o	read.table() now uses a single pass through the dataset.

    o	rep() now handles lists (as generic vectors).

    o	scan() has a new argument `multi.line' for S compatibility,
	but the default remains the opposite of S (records can cross
	line boundaries by default).

    o	sort(x) now produces an error when x is not atomic instead of
	just returning x.

    o	split() now allows splitting on a list of factors in which case
	their interaction defines the grouping.

    o	stl() has more optional arguments for fine tuning, a summary()
	and an improved plot() method.

    o	New function strwrap() for formatting character strings into
	paragraphs.

    o	New replacement functions substr<-() and substring<-().

    o	Dataset swiss now has row names.

    o	Arguments `pkg' and `lib' of system.file() have been renamed to
	`package' and `lib.loc', respectively, to be consistent with
	related functions.  The old names are deprecated.  Argument
	`package' must now specify a single package.

    o	The Wilcoxon and Ansari-Bradley tests now return point
	estimators of the location or scale parameter of interest along
	with confidence intervals for these.

    o	New function write.dcf() for writing data in Debian Control File
	format.	 parse.dcf() has been replaced by (much faster)	internal
	read.dcf().

    o	Contingency tables created by xtabs() or table() now have a
	summary() method.

    o	Functions httpclient(), read.table.url(), scan.url() and
	source.url() are now deprecated, and hence method="socket' in
	download.file() is.  Use url connections instead: in
	particular URLs can be specified for read.table(), scan() and
	source().

    o	Formerly deprecated function getenv() is now defunct.

    o	Support for package-specific demo scripts (R code).  demo() now
	has new arguments to specify the location of demos and to allow
	for running base demos as part of `make check'.

    o	If not explicitly given a library tree to install to or remove
	from, respectively, R CMD INSTALL and R CMD REMOVE now operate
	on the first directory given in `R_LIBS' if this is set and
	non-null, and the default library otherwise.

    o	R CMD INSTALL and package.description() fix some common problems
	of DESCRIPTION files (blank lines, ...)

    o	The INSTALL command for package installation allows a `--save'
	option.	 Using it causes a binary image of the package contents
	to be created at install time and loaded when the package is
	attached.  This saves time, but also uses a more standard way
	of source-ing the package.  Packages that do more than just
	assign object definitions may need to install with `--save'.
	Putting a file `INSTALL.R' in the package directory makes
	`--save' the default behavior.  If that file is not empty, its
	contents should be R commands executed at the end of creating
	the image.

	There is also a new command line option `--configure-vals' for
	passing variables to the configure script of a package.

    o	R CMD check now also checks the keyword entries against the list
	of standard keywords, for code/documentation mismatches (this
	can be turned off by the command line option `--no-codoc'), and
	for sufficient file permissions (Unix only).  There is a new check
	for the correct usage of library.dynam.

	It also has a new command line option `--use-gct' to use
	`gctorture(TRUE)' when running R code.

    o	R CMD Rd2dvi has better support for producing reference manuals
	for packages and package bundles.

    o	configure now tests for the versions of jpeg (>= 6b), libpng (>=
	1.0.5) and zlib (>= 1.1.3).  It no longer checks for the
	CXML/DXML BLAS libraries on Alphas.

    o	Perl scripts now use Cwd::cwd() in place of Cwd::getcwd(), as
	cwd() can be much faster.

    o	R::Dcf.pm can now also handle files with more than one record
	and checks (a little bit) for continuation lines without leading
	whitespace.

    o	New manual `R Installation and Administration' with fuller
	details on the installation process: file `INSTALL' is now a
	brief introduction referencing that manual.

    o	New keyword `internal' which can be used to hide objects that
	are not part of the API from indices like the alphabetical lists
	in the HTML help system.

    o   Under Unix, shlib modules for add-on packages are now linked
	against R as a shared library (`libR') if this exists.  (This
	allows for improved embedding of R into other applications.)

    o   New mechanism for explicitly registering native routines in a
	DLL/shared library accessible via .C(), .Call(), .Fortran() and
	.External().  This is potentially more robust than the existing
	dynamic lookup, since it checks the number of arguments, type of
	the routine.

    o	New mechanism allowing registration of C routines for converting
	R objects to C pointers in .C() calls.  Useful for references to
	data in other languages and libraries (e.g. C and hdf5).

    o	The internal ftp/http access code maintains the event loop, so
	you can download whilst running tcltk or Rggobi, say.  It can
	be hooked into package XML too.



BUG FIXES

    o	boxplot.stats() now returns the correct `n' component in the case of
	NAs. This also affects `conf', the notch length (PR#967).

    o	the "coef = 0" fix (PR#917) to boxplot.stats() broke
	boxplot.stats(do.out = FALSE).

    o	curve(* , add = FALSE) now works correctly again if used when
	par("xlog") is true.

    o	Printing a dataframe with a column called "row.names" or
	"check.names" omitted the column.

    o	data.frame(a=1, b=2)[1, -(1:2)]	 now works, giving an empty
	data frame.  as.matrix(df), deparse(), dput() and str() now work
	for empty data frames.

    o	dbeta() could return zero erroneously on some platforms where
	roundoff makes e.g. 1.3 - 1 > (1.3 + 1) - 2 (Solaris and HP-UX
	were affected). (PR#970)

    o	pointer protection in deriv() (PR#953)

    o   expand.data.frame() didn't interpret its subset= argument in
        the data frame. (PR#979 et al., fix from Greg Warnes)

    o	format() on character arrays was losing the dimensions.

    o	hist.default() was ignoring its `probability' argument for
	equi-spaced breaks.

    o	Occasionally insane results of is.nan(NULL), is.na(NULL) (PR#952)

    o	ks.test() in package ctest now had the one-sided alternatives in
	the one-sample case reversed (PR#934).

    o	ls.str() and lsf.str() now work better with pos > 1, and are
	correctly documented (PR#899).

    o	plot(1:2, xaxs = "i") now gives both "1.0" and "2.0" x-axis labels.

    o	promax() was not using its `m' argument (m=4 was always used).

    o	qr.X() was ignoring pivoting (which happens only in
	rank-deficient cases).

    o   sign of Pearson residuals was wrong for reciprocal link (PR#862)

    o	The algorithm for determining starting estimates in the SSfpl
	self-starting model in the nls package was changed following a
	suggestion by Phillipe Grosjean <phgrosje at ulb.ac.be>

    o	svd(x)$v was not a matrix when x had only 1 row (PR#963).

    o	symnum(x) behaves more reasonably for zero length or non-numeric x.

    o	The implementation of sys.function() did not work when the
	current function was already a function (e.g., a closure).

    o   tapply() had "..." argument after simplify=, which made it
	incompatible with S when passing additional unnamed arguments to FUN.

    o   use formula environments in xy.coords() (PR#932)


    o	Unused entry points in `src/appl/fortran.c' and `Fortran.h'
	have been removed.

    o	Unused directory `src/f2clib' and header `src/include/R_ext/f2c.h'
	have been removed.

    o	The documentation and parts of the parse/deparse mechanism
	indicated that there was an operator `%'. Corrected (PR#925).

    o	Fixed some cases where the deparser gave code that threw a
	syntax error when parsed.

    o	Using a pushback with more than two lines at a time could crash.

    o	Eliminate or warn on use of .Last.value in help examples, since
	.Last.value is only set from top-level expressions (and was
	incorrectly documented).

    o	asInteger was ignoring integer overflow (PR#929 and others).

    o	approxfun(*, ties = <fun>) could return garbage when there were ties;
	ties = "ordered" was incorrect--also for approx()-- when there was
	a tie at the very right.

Subject: R-1.3.0 for OS X (with X11/tcl/tk, and gnome support)
Message-ID: <200106222241.PAA36182@pine.frazmtn.com>

At http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R you can now find

R-1.3.0-OSX.tar.gz (it's about 22 MB)

This file has support for X11, tcl/tk, and gnome. It uses many
dynamic libs, which are NOT included. If you need one (because
R cannot find foo.dylib, just ask me, I'll send it, and you put it in 
the appropriate
place). You could also install Xfree/XDarwin, plus dlcompat,
plus all the gnome stuff from fink (fink.sourceforge.net) -- but
that will take some time. This version has been build with f2c,
not with the new f77.

You unzip and untar in /, everything is put in /usr/local (so
you probably must sudo).

The file also contains compiled versions of the following
packages (latest versions):

Subject: R-1.3.0 SuSE RPMs
Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.4.21.0106251231070.16769-100000@zidsrv.sci.uni-klu.ac.at>



Hi,

SuSE 7.2 RPMs of R-1.3.0 and the current contrib packages are available at
CRAN (and soon on it's mirrors) at 

  ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/bin/linux/suse

RPMs for older SuSE versions will be available at 

  ftp://ftp-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/R/bin/old/linux/suse

soon (not mirrored to CRAN sites).

These packages are NOT compatible with my old SuSE RPMs, (R_HOME is now
(again) /usr/local/lib/R and no more /usr/lib/R, packages are linked with
the libR.so library, contrib packages may require R 1.3.0, ...)

The contrib RPMs and it's SPEC files are automatically generated using the 

  ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/bin/linux/suse/build-contrib-rpms.pl

script (also available at ftp://ftp-stat.uni-klu.ac.at/pub/R/contrib/).

All (base and contrib) RPMs had to pass "make check" or "R CMD check" to
be built successfully.

Logfiles of the build runs are available in the 7.2/RPMS/i386/build.log
subdirectory. If you want to know why the RPM of some special package is
not available, you may find the reason somewhere in these logfiles (e.g. 
R CMD check did not succeed, some prerequisites are not fulfilled on my
build host, ...)

Instead of providing the SRPM files I put now only the according rpm spec
files into the SPECS subdirectory. This should save much space on CRAN and
its mirrors. Using these spec files and downloading the original sources
from according CRAN paths you can rebuild the RPMs the same way as it
would be possible with the SRPM files.


Best wishes

       http://sirio.stat.unipd.it/RWin 
It will be mirrored at a CRAN site near you in a couple of days.
See below for a list of Windows-specific changes.

                Windows-specific changes to R
                =============================

rw1030
======

SetupR.exe and miniR* now include the nine `recommended' packages,
so the miniR* distribution needs six floppies rather than four.

Rgui has a new menu `Packages' with items to load packages, to install
packages from CRAN or from local zip files, and to update packages.

The packages list shown by help.start() now includes all packages in
all libraries, but the search index is still confined to the system
library.

The installers set up a file association for *.RData files, so
double-clicking on a *.RData file launches R in that directory and
loads the *.RData file.  Also, a *.RData file can be dropped onto a
shortcut to Rgui (or Rterm) on the desktop or in Windows Explorer.

Drag-and-drop of images (.RData and .rda) and source files (.R)
onto the Rgui.exe console window is now supported.

Profiling (as described in `Writing R Extensions') is now available.

There is a new `Save as PDF' option on the graphics device menu.

bringToTop() can specify the console window in Rgui (as -1).

The default graphics device is now windows() only in interactive use:
otherwise it is postscript().  (This affects the DCOM interface, which
is not interactive use.)

Support for earlier (pre-Feb 2000) mingw compilers has been dropped:
you must use a compiler system that supports --shared and has an
in-memory dlltool.

Rcmd check has been changed to be more robust to reported problems
with Perl's system() command under 16-bit versions of Windows.  It now
works for us under Windows 98.  (It has always worked under NT4 and
2000.)

Rcmd SHLIB no longer adds a version tab to the DLL, as this seemed to
cause some people problems under Windows 95/98/ME.

The correct file version information should now appear on Windows 2000
Version tab under Properties (working around a Windows 2000 bug).

rwinst.exe is no longer part of the distribution: use the newer
installers to install R, and the Packages menu in Rgui.exe to install
pre-compiled packages, or use an external unzip program.

The old-style Windows help is no longer part of the standard distribution,
but can be made from the sources.  It is no longer tested.

Make targets such as test-Reg have been moved to directory rw1030\tests.

The default internet module modules\internet.dll is built using basic
WinSock calls.  There is an alternative modules\internet2.dll which uses
WinInet calls (and so needs Internet Explorer installed) which can be
used as a replacemnet.

Subject: new package 'strucchange'
Message-ID: <3B3B065E.4C80E7CA@ci.tuwien.ac.at>


There is a new package on CRAN called 'strucchange' providing functions
for testing on structural change in linear regression relationships.
It features tests/methods from the generalized fluctuation test
framework as well as from the F test (Chow test) framework. This
includes methods to fit, plot and test fluctuation processes (e.g.,
CUSUM, MOSUM, recursive/moving estimates) and F statistics,
respectively. Furthermore it is possible to monitor incoming data
online.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0106291419440.23682-100000@matheron.estadi.uv.es>


Hello:

 There is a new release (0.1) of the package RArcInfo at CRAN. I have made
many changes to the source code and the functions now returns data frames
(when possible) instead of lists, that are easier to edit and modify (in
my opinion).

 Besides, the package works under Windows too.

 I would like to ask to the developers who maintain the binaries (for
WINDOWS and LINUX) to recompile this package and upload it to CRAN. Can
anyone test the packege under Mac? Thanks.

 Feedback from the users are always welcome.

 Regards,

  Virgilio G?mez Rubio

Subject: Debian packages for R-1.3.0
Message-ID: <6r8zibqesn.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>


I have installed the binary packages for Debian GNU/Linux release 2.3
(woody) in the U.S. mirror of the CRAN archive.  They should propagate
to the main CRAN archive within a day and to the other mirrors within
two days.

These packages have been compiled with gcc-3.0 and g77-3.0.  I believe
the testing distribution currently provides only a snapshot of
gcc-3.0, not the latest released version, so this may cause problems
with installation under the testing distribution.  I can recompile the
packages if this becomes too awkward.  Let me know if you need this.

These packages have been linked against Camm Maguire's latest
atlas2-base package for Atlas.  I would recommend getting that - it is
a much more recent version of Atlas.

I need a volunteer to compile the packages on a Debian 2.2 (potato)
system.  Thomas Lumley has done that but I know he is very busy now
and I don't want to impose on him.  If you have a machine running the
stable Debian distribution and could create the package, please
contact me.

Subject: R-1.3.0 full update (151 packages)
Message-ID: <200108201500.IAA41864@pine.frazmtn.com>


You may want to wait for R-1.3.1, but there is a new version 
R-1.3.0-MacOSX.tar.gz
in http//www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R. It's in the folder "overfull", 
and it

-- will be updated to 1.3.1 as soon as that exists

-- has support for gnome, tcl/tk, and atlas

-- includes 151 add-on packages (see the list in packages.txt). Most of 
them have
    been updated to the latest CRAN versions.

-- uses the newest versions of the readline, dlcompat, gnome, f2c, 
atlas, tcl/tk libraries
    (all from fink, see fink.sourceforge.net)

-- has the necessary dylibs in the folder "dylibs". If you find you need 
one,
    because R asks for it, download it and install it. If R asks for one
    which is not there, drop me an email.

-- has five screenshots in the folder "screenshots", a small sample of 
the
    many possibilities.

    a. One has rootless XFree86 with the gnome interface for R. This may 
be as close
    to the Carbon version as you can get with Xfree.
    b. The Aqua rootless mode is fine if you want to interact directly 
with Carbon and
    Cocoa applications. The second screenshot is full screen X11, and 
proud of it.
    It has some tcl/tk demos running.
    c. The windowmanager for the first two screenshots is blackbox, and 
you see two
    fancy eterm windows running as well (with dragons and far-away 
planets and stuff).
    The third screenshot uses the sawfish window manager, running in a 
gnome-session.
    d. If you don't like gnome (most sane persons don't), then screenshot 
four
    uses the ice window manager, and shows another tcltk demo. Look in 
the lower
    left hand corner of this screen -- you are running Linux. And on a
    decent computer too.
    e. Finally, there is a screenshot which uses the Xtools Aqua window 
manager in rootless
    mode.  This is obviously close to optimal for Mac junkies. By the 
way, the gnome gui
    does not work with XTools.

Note:
Running cksum on the file it should give

3276119375 28310961 R-1.3.0-MacOSX.tar.gz

Note:
If you install fink on your system, you will have easy access to the 
following
window managers: twm, mwm, pwm, fvwm, xfwm, icewm, blackbox, 
enlightenment, windowmaker, sawfish, oroborus, afterstep. Xtools adds 
the Aqua window manager.
Thus you can make your Mac look like a machine running vanilla X11, 
Motif, NextStep, Gnome, and even Aqua/Quartz.

Subject: R-1.3.1 is released 
Message-ID: <x2heuos597.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-1.3.1.tgz a short while ago. This is a minor upgrade,
fixing a number of bugs and only containing a few small new features.
The most immediately visible new feature is that "less" is used for
viewing help pages if available.

A set of recommended packages which have been tested with R-1.3.1 has
been bundled up. Binary distributions are expected to include these
packages. The mgcv package is included this time (we intended to have
it in 1.3.0, but encountered portability problems).

Please note (as for 1.3.0) that the former "survival5" package is now
named "survival". If you install over an existing installation which
has survival5 installed, make sure to "R CMD REMOVE survival5"

You can get the files from the developer site

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.1.tgz

or wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. This will
probably happen after the weekend due to circumstances in Vienna.
Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

There are also versions split for floppies, and a patch file relative
to R-1.3.0.


        For the R Core Team,

        Peter D.


Here's the relevant part of the NEWS file:


                CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.1


NEW FEATURES

    o   massage-examples is now a Perl script and about 50x faster.

    o   On Unix(-alike) systems the default pager is now determined
        during configuration, and is `less' if available, otherwise
        `more' (and not `more -s' as previously).

    o   configure now tests for strptime functions that fail on inputs
        before 1970 (found on Irix).  It no longer checks for the SCSL
        and SGIMATH libraries on Irix.

    o   New formula interface to cor.test() in package ctest.

    o   "NA" is now a valid color name (as NA has been a valid integer
        color).

    o   pairs() function has a new `gap' argument for adjusting the
        spacing between panels.

    o   R CMD check has a new test for unbalanced braces in Rd files.

    o   readBin() has a new argument `signed' to simplify reading
        unsigned 8- and 16-bit integers.

    o   New capabilities() option "cledit".

    o   Modified restore code to give clearer error messages in some cases.



BUG FIXES

    o   Fixed placement of mtext() output (including tick labels)
        when text is perpendicular to axis AND axis is logged
        (PR#997 and PR#865).

    o   rect() and arrows() now respond to setting of par(xpd)

    o   abline() now responds to the setting of par(xpd), including
        via the "..." argument (PR#750).

    o   Using cat() to a gzfile() connection no longer compresses poorly
        (at the expense of some latency).

    o   The `exact' p-values for the two-sided two-sample
        Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in 1.3.0 were for the wrong tail.

    o   In the HTML conversion of .Rd files, \link[foo]{bar} was
        ignoring [foo] outside \code{} statements.

    o   lm.influence(), plot.lm(), influence.measures() and the
        related diagnostic measures now handle lm() fits with
        na.action=na.exclude.

    o   Eliminated segmentation fault in while loops without braces
        in their bodies.

    o   barplot did not accept NA heights unless ylim was specified.

    o   predict.lm() failed with single-column model matrix (PR#1018).

    o   legend() now also works with 100s of entries (thanks to
        M. Schlather).

    o   A long-standing bug leading to inaccuracy in polyroot() has been
        fixed (PR#751)

    o   A very old bug with eval() not handling a numeric `envir' argument
        according to specifications has been fixed. [This in particular
        broke ported S-PLUS code that used eval(..., sys.parent())]. Also,
        eval() now checks that a numeric `envir' has length one to prevent
        accidental passing of matrices instead of data frames.

    o   The C code underlying nlm(f, *) now also works correctly when f(x)
        returns +Inf {nlm() itself *did* work!}.

    o   pdfcolor.tex is now included in doc/manual, as pdftex seems no
        longer to include it.

    o   Fixed protect bug in save() code that might have been responsible
        for occasionally saving corrupted workspaces.

    o   capabilities("X11") now reports if X11 is available in this
        session, thereby giving the correct answer if --gui=none was
        specified.

    o   Rd files with ,, inside \code{} were treating this as a
        ligature in LaTeX: now corrected in Rdconv.

    o   dlopen on Compaq Tru64 was finding the wrong entry points:
        worked-around by using different names in the modules.

    o   plot.mts() allows a type argument again (broken in 1.3.0: PR#1010).

    o   scan() has a limit of 8190 on the length of char strings, and
        now warns if it is exceeded (when the string has always been
        truncated).

    o   par adj now accepts values of integer mode (such as text(adj=0:1)).

    o   horizontal adj values outside the range [0, 1] are now
        supported on devices with canHAdj==1 (Windows devices, xfig).

    o   xtabs() without a response was ignoring drop.unused.levels=TRUE.

    o   readLines(ok=FALSE) was not generating an error when it should.

    o   princomp(covmat=) has been broken.

    o   Many documentation clean-ups: formerly undocumented arguments,
        use of T/F rather than TRUE/FALSE.

    o   df[] <- foo now works for data frames (PR#1047).

    o   nargs() was documented incorrectly.

    o   Using seq.POSIXt(by="2 weeks") was stepping by single weeks
        (PR#1046).

    o   dummy.coef.lm was not handling complex terms like z:I(x).
        It now either does or warns and gives NAs (PR#1048).

    o   predict.mlm() was broken (PR#1049).

    o   ksmooth (in package modreg) was using points to the left
        of the kernel under some circumstances (PR#1050).

    o   attr(x, "class") <- character(0) was segfaulting.  Similar problem
        with "comment" attribute also fixed.

    o   loadings() results from PCA (as well as from factor analysis)
        are now printed by print.loadings.

    o   Using chol() on an non-positive-definite matrix gave an
        misleading error message (PR#1061).

    o   as.character() on a language object was truncating to about 70
        characters: the internal limit (from the deparse code) is now the
        maximum possible 500.

    o   X11() device was failing to re-initialize correctly after all
        devices were shut down, so the colortype could not be changed
        and some systems showed protocol errors. (PR#1065)

    o   Converting Inf and NaN values by as.character() and reading by
        scan() was supported by strtod on some platforms and not
        others: these are now handled by R itself. (PR#1072)

    o   hclust(dist(1)) doesn't loop infinitely but signal an error.

    o   cutree() can now cut outside heights and does not return
        garbage for h >= max(tree$heights) anymore. (PR#1067)

    o   interaction(...,drop=F) returned an object looking like a
        factor, but with storage mode "double", confusing
        model.matrix.default (PR#1003)

    o   splineDesign(*, ord=) and others give better error messages for
        wrong `ord' (and have slightly improved documentation).

Subject: Ann: New package rpvm 0.2
Message-ID: <s8rpu9av9y6.fsf@apollo2.stat.washington.edu>



An new package, rpvm 0.2 has been uploaded to
ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming.  Here is the DESCRIPTION, 

Package: rpvm
Version: 0.2
Date: $Date: 2001/08/30 21:44:37 $
Title: R interface to PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) 
Author: Na (Michael) Li <lina at u.washington.edu> and 
  A. J. Rossini <rossini at u.washington.edu>.
Maintainer: Na (Michael) Li <lina at u.washington.edu>
Depends: R (>= 1.2.0)
Description: Provides interface to PVM APIs, and examples and
  documentation for its use.  
License: GPL version 2 or newer
URL: http://www.r-project.org/, 
     http://software.biostat.washington.edu/statsoft/snake/

PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine, http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html or
http://www.netlib.org/pvm3/, ) is a de facto standard message passing library
for distributed cluster computing. It runs on existing network of
heterogeneous computers.  RPVM provides interfaces to PVM APIs, and enables
parallel statistical computation in an environment already familiar to
statisticians.

Note that because of its dependence on PVM, R CMD check won't work out of box.
However, once pvm is properly set up and running, the examples in demo should
work.  A technical report describing rpvm is available upon request.

Comments are most welcome.

Michael

Subject: R-1.3.1 for Windows
Message-ID: <20010904170011.47357@hal.stat.unipd.it>


A binary distribution of R-1.3.1 to run on Windows 95, 98, NT4.0 and 2000 
on Intel/clone chips is available at
       http://sirio.stat.unipd.it/RWin

It will be mirrored at a CRAN site near you in a couple of days.
See below for a list of Windows-specific changes.
 
guido masarotto
(for the R-core team)

                Windows-specific changes to R 
                ============================= 
Lines with lty > 1 and many pieces were being drawn very slowly on
Windows 2000 (but not 98/ME).  To work around this, such lines are
now drawn 5000 pieces at a time.

The dialog for the `Change dir' item now uses a standard folder
selection widget for its Browse button.                 

White backgrounds are now omitted for metafiles (as they are for
postscript, PDF and XFig plots), so white backgounds (the default)
appear to be transparent.                     

help.start() now updates the HTML search index (as well as the
packages index) when it is started up.  link.html.help() works better
when R_LIBS omits the drive, and uses relative links for the main
library, so R installations can be relocated in the file system. 

The background colour of the GUI preferences editor and the
select.list() popup is now taken from the Windows colour scheme.

Rcmd INSTALL now rejects invalid options for --docs (rather than
ignoring them), and checks for the R version in the DESCRIPTION file
exactly the same way as Rcmd check (so with fewer spurious messages).

Added support for building with the ATLAS optimized BLAS library: on a
PII this speeds up La.svd on a 500x500 matrix by about 30%, and the
multiplication of two 1000x1000 matrices by about 8x. See INSTALL.

The recommended compiler system has been changed, but that recommended
for rw1030 still works.

Subject: New package pixmap
Message-ID: <15262.16730.432546.63278@galadriel.ci.tuwien.ac.at>



A new package called `pixmap' has been released on CRAN. From the
DESCRIPTION file:

Package: pixmap
Version: 0.2-1
Title:  Bitmap Images (``Pixel Maps'')
Depends: R (>= 1.3)
Author: Friedrich Leisch and Roger Bivand
Maintainer: Friedrich Leisch <Friedrich.Leisch at ci.tuwien.ac.at>
Description: Functions for import, export, plotting and other
  manipulations of bitmapped images. 
License: GPL version 2.


The package is intended to provide the central low-level support for
reading/writing/plotting bitmapped images. It replaces the read.pnm
and write.pnm functions of package e1071. Currently only PNM images
are supported for import/export, but we want to add other filter real
soon.

A rich class structure is already in place, allowing for grey, rgb and
indexed images together with conversions between all three
formats. The classes allow images also to have a coordinate system
attached, such that, e.g., locator() can be used meaningfully on
geographical maps. 

This is a first release, all comments and feedback are more than
welcome (thanks to Jonathan Marchini for valuable feedback on the
first development version).

Best,
Fritz Leisch

Hi

There are new versions of the grid and lattice packages on CRAN:
    grid 0.2 and lattice 0.3-0

These packages are still _under development_ (they are in
CRAN/src/contrib/Devel)

There have been some bug fixes and, especially in lattice, there are lots of
new features.
Descriptions of the changes are included below.

If you have any grid code, it may break under the new version because of a
change to the interface of the pop.viewport() function -- see the changes
below.

Many thanks to those who have provided feedback and suggestions for
corrections/improvements.
Don't worry if you can't see your suggestion in the new version;  it just
means we haven't found time to try to implement it yet :)

Changes from grid_0.1 to grid_0.2:

1. Fixed bug in rotating viewports;  this should be more reliable now (the
rotation of
    viewports, not the bug!).

2. Added grid.line.to() and grid.move.to().  These allow drawing BETWEEN
   different coordinate systems.  See example in inst/doc/demo3.ps.

3. Added some more demonstrations to the doc directory.

4. Added more test code to the tests directory.

5. Added "grobwidth" and "grobheight" units.  See the document
   grid/inst/doc/advanced/parentchild.ps

6. Added more detailed documentation to grid/inst/doc/advanced.  This
   stuff is not necessarily very friendly for the reader, but may be useful
if you're
   tearing your hair out wondering why some strange effect is occurring.

7. Changed frames and packing to use the new "grobwidth" and "grobheight"
   units.  This fixes some problems with frames and packing.

8. Fixed a bug where the gpar settings for "fontsize" and "lineheight"
   _within a grob_ would not affect the location or size of the grob
   if they were specified in "lines" or "char" units.

   This required adding new "mylines" and "mychar" units (alternative
   suggestions for names welcome !) so that you can specify whether
   a grob's a location/size is in terms of the current viewport's
   fontsize and lineheight ("lines" and "char") or in terms of its own
   fontsize and lineheight ("mylines" and "mychar").

9. Added grid.polygon() and grid.circle() primitives

10. Added newpage=TRUE argument to grid.start() so that you can restart
    grid graphics mode without having to move to a new page.

    For example, try ...

     postscript()
     grid.start()
     grid.polygon()
     grid.stop()
     grid.start() # moves to new page
     grid.circle()
     grid.stop()
     grid.start(newpage=FALSE) # does NOT move to new page
     grid.rect()
     grid.stop()
     dev.off()

11. Changed interface for pop.viewport().  This now just takes a
    number of viewports to pop, which defaults to 1.
    For example ...

        push.viewport(viewport())
        pop.viewport(current.viewport())

    ... becomes ...

        push.viewport(viewport())
        pop.viewport()

    ... and ...

        vp1 <- viewport()
        vp2 <- viewport()
        push.viewport(vp1, vp2)
        pop.viewport(vp2, vp1)

    ... becomes ...

        vp1 <- viewport()
        vp2 <- viewport()
        push.viewport(vp1, vp2)
        pop.viewport(2)

12. Speed-up of pushing and popping viewports.  This will probably not
    be noticeable in normal usage, but makes a big difference for
    frames and packing.

13. Added a convertNative() function for converting a unit object
    to "user" or "data" coordinates.  This is useful for performing
    calculations (e.g., smoothing) on a location or dimension which
    is easiest to specify in units.

    You must specify whether you wish to convert relative to the
    current x- or y-scale AND whether you are converting a location
    or a dimension.  The following example shows the difference:

       > push.viewport(viewport(w=unit(4,"inches"), xscale=c(-10,10)))
       > convertNative(unit(1:4, "inches"))
       [1] -5  0  5 10
       > convertNative(unit(1:4, "inches"), "y")
       [1] 0.1430986 0.2861972 0.4292958 0.5723944  # on my default window
size
       > convertNative(unit(1:4, "inches"), "y", "dimension")
       [1] 0.1430986 0.2861972 0.4292958 0.5723944
       > convertNative(unit(1:4, "inches"), "x", "dimension")
       [1]  5 10 15 20

    WARNING:  if you draw objects based on output from these conversion
    functions, then resize your device, the objects will be drawn
    incorrectly -- the base R display list will not recalculate these
    conversions.  This means that you can only rely on the results of
    these calculations if the size of your device is fixed.

    This change motivated by discussions with Frank Harrell.

Changes in lattice 0.3
======================

The overall internal structure of the lattice library has changed
considerably in verion 0.3, in particular making it far more readable
and debuggable. However, this also means that some code which had
worked with the earlier version might now fail. (This is just a
discalimer, there are no known instances.)

New Features:
============

 o (Almost) full support for the `key' argument for drawing legends

 o Support for log scales

 o levelplot (but no contourplot. In particular, the contour = T option
   in levelplot does not work)

 o tmd now works on the output from qq

 o panel function names can now be quoted strings

 o scales and its x and y components can now be just a character
   string like "free" or "sliced", i.e., the relation tag can be
   omitted.

 o extension to the `type' argument in panel.xyplot and
   panel.superpose to allow stair-like and histogram-like plots
   (type="s" and "h" in plot), as well as loess smooths (using
   the loess.smooth function in the modreg library). Also, more
   than one of these options can now be used concurrently. This
   allows, for example, a grouped plot where a grouping variable
   can be used to fit separate loess curves along with the scatter
   for each group. See example(xyplot)

 o wrappers around grid functions with API-s of traditional graphics
   functions to help port existing S-Plus Trellis code. See below for
   details.

 o changes in print.trellis to allow mixing of Lattice and usual R
   graphics. See below for details.

 o `data' can now be second unnamed argument in
   high level functions

 o `pscales' implemented for splom


Porting S-Plus Trellis code to Lattice
======================================

One of the basic problems in porting existing Trellis code to R is the
unusability of the base R functions like lines and points inside panel
functions. To help make the changes more transparently, lattice now
includes several wrappers around grid functions that provide an API
similar to the corresponding base R functions. The list currently
includes lpoints, llines, ltext and lsegments.


Using Lattice and base R graphics concurrently
==============================================

Grid graphics normally do not mix with usual R graphics. However,
end-users typically might want to use lattice functions concurrently
with traditional R graphics. To allow this without intermittent calls
to grid.stop() and grid.start(), print.trellis (which ultimately does
all the plotting in lattice) now tries to preserve the state of the
device on which it plots. By default, library(lattice) opens a device
in grid enabled mode. It can be reverted to non grid mode by
grid.stop(). Subsequently, both Lattice functions and traditional
graphics functions can be used. Devices opened by trellis.device()
start in non-grid mode, unless grid.start() is called.



Still Missing
=============

 o contourplot, wireframe, cloud (partially implemented) and of course,
   piechart

 o Some components of scale (I haven't found a full list, so
   can't say exactly which are missing)

 o Fonts

 o axis labels badly implemented, no checking for overlaps.

Subject: new version of e1071 on CRAN
Message-ID: <15292.6089.760015.233382@galadriel.ci.tuwien.ac.at>



A new version of e1071 has been released to CRAN which should be much
easier to install on a lot of platforms because reading/writing PNM
images has been moved to the pixmap package, hence there are no longer
dependencies on external libraries and no configure mechanism.

For the authors,
Fritz Leisch


**********************************************************

Changes in Version 1.2-0:

  o Added functions for bagged clustering, see help(bclust).

  o read.pnm() and write.pgm() have been removed from e1071, much
    improved versions can now be found in the new package pixmap. 

  o Lots of documentation updates and bugfixes.

  o Support Vector Machine interface now upgraded to libsvm V. 2.31
    featuring:
    - Multi-Class Classification
    - weighting of classes for C-classification (for asymmetric sample sizes)
    - nu-regression
    - Formula Interface
    - k-fold cross-validation
    In addition, an introductory article is provided in directory
    `docs/' (svmdoc.pdf).

  o classAgreement now features an option to match factor levels

  o updated API design for the fuzzy clustering functions
    (cmeans, cshell, scaclust). Documentation updates and function
    name changes (cmeanscl -> cmeans, validity.measures -> fclustIndex)

Subject: stochastic course notes with R
Message-ID: <200110171049.MAA21217@luc.ac.be>


I have just put the postscript file for the first draft of a
manuscript of a course on The Statistical Analysis of Stochastic
Processes in Time, as well as the R code to do all of the examples, on
my web page at

www.luc.ac.be/~jlindsey/manuscripts.html

The chapters are
Part I Basic principles
 1. What is a stochastic process?
 2. Normal theory models and extensions.
Part II Categorical state space
 3. Survival processes.
 4. Recurrent events.
 5. Discrete-time Markov chains.
 6. Event histories.
 7. Dynamic models.
 8. More complex dependencies.
Part III Continuous state space
 9. Time series.
10. Growth curves.
11. Dynamic models.
12. Repeated measurements.

Although it contains chapters on survival analysis and time series, as
far as I have been able to see, the ts and survival libraries are not
capable of performing the analyses that I required, except for some of
the simple plots.

As a reminder, the following books all have complete R code available
on my web page as well:

Introductory Statistics. A Modelling Approach. OUP, 1995 0-19-852345-9
	(also instructor's manual can be downloaded)
Models for Repeated Measurements. (2nd edn) OUP, 1999 0-19-850559-0
Nonlinear Models in Medical Statistics. OUP, 2001 0-19-850812-3

Of course, all four require my R libraries available at

www.luc.ac.be/~jlindsey/rcode.html

Comments and criticisms are very welcome.

Subject: bugfix release of e1071
Message-ID: <15318.47880.81171.759753@galadriel.ci.tuwien.ac.at>



A bugfix release of package e1071 that passes `Rcmd check' on windows
has been uploaded to CRAN.

Changes in Version 1.2-1:

  o Bug fixes in cmeans.c, cshell.c and scaclust.c (R header files
    included and unused variables removed)
  
  o Bug fixes in Rsvm.c and svm.R (incomplete list of returned Support 
    Vectors).

  o Encapsulate kmeans call in bclust() in a try construct, because
    kmeans gives an error when a cluster becomes empty (which can
    happen for almost every data set from time to time).

Subject: New package: g.data
Message-ID: <15371.42846.422155.287658@gargle.gargle.HOWL>


A new package "g.data" is available on CRAN, to create and maintain databases
that work more like the S-Plus model.

Here's the official Description for g.data (v1.2):
  Create and maintain delayed-data packages (DDP's).  Data stored in
  a DDP are available on demand, but do not take up memory until requested.
  You attach a DDP with g.data.attach(), then read from it and assign to it in
  a manner similar to S-Plus, except that you must run g.data.save() to
  actually commit to disk.

Here's a very abbreviated (Unix) example:
  g.data.attach("/tmp/mydir")             # Open package:mydir in pos=2
  assign("x1", matrix(1, 1000, 1000), 2)  # Put data there
  g.data.save()                           # Commit to disk
  detach(2)                               # Detach package:mydir
  g.data.attach("/tmp/mydir")             # Re-attach it, no resources used
  dim(x1)                                 # x1 is loaded only when needed!
  find("x1")                              # It still lives in package:mydir

g.data is the end result of my post "Reading and writing to S-like databases",
sent to R-help on Sep 28, 2001.  Thanks to all who responded, especially
Dr. Agustin Lobo <alobo at ija.csic.es> and (by reference) Ray Brownrigg
<Ray.Brownrigg at mcs.vuw.ac.nz>, who suggested using delay(); Martin Maechler
<maechler at stat.math.ethz.ch>, Thomas Lumley <tlumley at u.washington.edu>, Brian
D. Ripley <ripley at stats.ox.ac.uk>, and Peter Dalgaard
<p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk>, who helped me with platform independence issues;
and Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik at ci.tuwien.ac.at>, who cleaned it up for CRAN.

I have one concern: g.data relies heavily on delay(), whose documentation says:
  This is an experimental feature and its addition is purely for
  evaluation purposes.
Is there any plan to deprecate delay()?

Feedback is welcome!

A new binary RPM of R (1.3.1-4mdk), compiled for Mandrake 8.1, is
available for download.

Added functionality is that R is now automatically added to desktop menus.

SRPM's, with instructions on how to compile, are also available for those
who wish to build the new package on other versions of Mandrake (and
hopefully contribute it): I will only support 8.1 in the future (I know R
1.4.0 is not very far away).

Subject: new versions of grid and lattice
Message-ID: <011d01c18777$6e5c5f50$7632d882@stat.auckland.ac.nz>


Hi

New versions of the grid and lattice packages will be available with the
release of R 1.4 (in a couple of days):

    grid_0.5
    lattice_0.3-1

These packages will no longer be in the "development" directory (i.e., they
will be in CRAN/src/contrib).

The changes in this release are mostly to grid, with lattice modified just
to take account of those changes.

Some important points about the grid changes are ...

(i)  grid_0.5 will only work with R version 1.4 or later.

(ii)  The main new features are support for clipping to viewports and
support for multiple devices.  See the file grid/doc/changes_0.5.txt for
other changes.

(iii)  There is a known bug on Windows;  turning on plot history recording
while producing grid graphics will crash R.  Adding individual plots to the
plot history seems to work ok.

(iv)  Some things still missing are:  vector fonts, mathematical annotation,
compatibility with base graphics, and many helpful suggestions from users
that I still haven't found time to get to! :)

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Wed Dec 19 12:41:07 2001
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 19 Dec 2001 12:41:07 +0100
Subject: R-1.4.0 is released
Message-ID: <x23d27e8to.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've rolled up R-1.4.0.tgz a short while ago. This is a major upgrade,
with several new features.

A set of recommended packages which have been tested with R-1.4.0 has
been bundled up. Binary distributions are expected to include these
packages.

You can get the files from the developer site

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0.tgz
ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0-recommended.tgz

or

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0.tgz
http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0-recommended.tgz

or wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. This may not
happen right away due to circumstances in Vienna. Binaries for various
platforms will appear in due course.

As usual, we try to ensure that R can be built on as many platforms as
possible. However, this time the problem with Fortran dynamic
libraries on RedHat 6.2, which previously only affected some packages,
has caught up with the main distribution. I.e. you cannot build R on
that platform without upgrading the compiler suite (building with f2c
probably works).

There are also versions split for floppies.


        For the R Core Team,

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.4.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    [This is a new section to highlight changes in behaviour, which
    may be given in more detail in the following sections.
    Many bug fixes are also user-visible changes.]

    o	The default save format has been changed, so saved workspaces
	and objects cannot (by default) be read in earlier versions of R.

    o	The number of bins selected by default in a histogram uses
	the correct version of Sturges' formula and will usually be
	one larger.

    o	data.frame() no longer converts logical arguments to factors
	(following S4 rather than S3).

    o	read.table() has new arguments `nrows' and `colClasses'.  If the
	latter is NA (the default), conversion is attempted to
	logical, integer, numeric or complex, not just to numeric.

    o	model.matrix() treats logical variables as a factors with
	levels c(FALSE, TRUE) (rather than 0-1 valued numerical
	variables).  This makes R compatible with all S versions.

    o	Transparency is now supported on most graphics devices.
	This means that using par("bg"), for example in legend(), will
	by default give a transparent rather than opaque background.

    o	[dpqr]gamma now has third argument `rate' for S-compatibility
	(and for compatibility with exponentials).  Calls which use
	positional matching may need to be altered.

    o	The meaning of spar = 0 in smooth.spline() has changed.

    o	substring() and substring()<- do nothing silently on a
	character vector of length 0, rather than generating an
	error.	This is consistent with other functions and with S.

    o	For compatibility with S4, any arithmetic operation using a
	zero-length vector has a zero-length result.  (This was
	already true for logical operations, which were compatible
	with S4 rather than S3.)

    o	undoc() and codoc() have been moved to the new package `tools'.

    o	The name of the site profile now defaults to
	`R_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site'.

    o	The startup process for setting environment variables now first
	searches for a site environment file (given by the environment
	variable `R_ENVIRON' if set or `R_HOME/etc/Renviron.site' if
	not), *and* then for a user `.Renviron' file in the current or
	the user's home directory.

    o	Former stars(*, colors = v) must now be stars(*, col.segments = v).

    o	The default methods for La.svd and La.eigen have changed and
	so there may be sign changes in singular/eigen vectors,
	including in cancor, cmdscale, factanal, princomp and varimax.


NEW FEATURES

    o	Transparency is now supported on most graphics devices.
	Internally colors include an alpha channel for opacity, but at
	present there is only visible support for transparent/opaque.
	The new color "transparent" (or NA or "NA") is transparent,
	and is the default background color for most devices.  Those
	devices (postscript, XFig, PDF, Windows metafile and printer)
	that previously treated bg = "white" as transparent now have
	"transparent" as the default and will actually print "white".
	(NB: you may have bg = "white" saved in .Postscript.options in
	your workspace.)

    o	A package `methods' has been added, containing formal classes
	and methods ("S4" methods), implementing the description in
	the book "Programming with Data".  See "?Methods" and the
	references there for more information.

	- In support of this, the "@" operator has been added to the
	  grammar.

	- Method dispatch for formal methods (the standardGeneric
	  function), is now a primitive. Aside from efficiency issues,
	  this allows S3-style generics to also have formal methods
	  (not really recommended in the long run, but it should at
	  least work).	The C-level dispatch is now implemented for
	  primitives that use either DispatchGroup or DispatchOrEval
	  internally.

	- A version of the function "plot" in the methods package has
	  arguments "x" and "y", to allow methods for either or both.
	  See "?setMethod" for examples of such methods.

	- The methods package now uses C-level code (from within
	  DispatchOrEval) to dispatch any methods defined for
	  primitive functions.	As with S3-style methods, methods can
	  only be defined if the first argument satisfies is.object(x)
	  (not strictly required for formal methods, but imposed for
	  now for simplicity and efficiency).

    o	Changes to the tcltk package:

	- New interface for accessing Tcl variables, effectively
	  making the R representations lexically scoped. The old form
	  is being deprecated.

	- Callbacks can now be expressions, with slightly unorthodox
	  semantics. In particular this allows bindings to contain
	  "break" expressions (this is necessary to bind code to
	  e.g. Alt-x without having the key combination also insert an
	  "x" in a text widget.)

	- A bunch of file handling and dialog functions (previously
	  only available via tkcmd) have been added

    o	The "?" operator is now an actual function.  It can be used
	(as always) as a unary operator (?plot) and the grammar now
	allows it as a binary operator, planned to allow
	differentiating documentation on the same name but different
	type (class?matrix, for example).  So far, no such
	documentation exists.

    o	New methods AIC.default() and logLik.glm(), also fixing
	AIC(<glm obj>).

    o	axis.POSIXct() allows the label date/times to be specified
	via the new `at' argument.

    o	arrows() now allows length = 0 (and draws no arrowheads).

    o	Modifications to the access functions for more consistency with S:
	arguments `name', `pos' and `where' are more flexible in
	assign(), exists(), get(), ls(), objects(), remove() and rm().

    o	Three new primitive functions have been added to base:
	dataClass(), objWithClass(), and as.environment().  The first two
	are support routines for class() and class<-() in package
	methods.  The third replaces pos.to.env() in the functions get(),
	exists(), and friends.

    o	barplot() now respects an inline `cex.axis' argument and has a
	separate `cex.names' argument so names and the numeric axis
	labels can be scaled separately.  Also, graphics parameters
	intended for axis() such as `las' can now be used.

    o	Shading by lines added to functions barplot(), hist(),
	legend(), piechart(), polygon() and rect().

    o	bxp() has a show.names argument allowing labels on a single
	boxplot; it and hence boxplot() now makes use of pch, cex, and bg
	for outlier points().

	bxp() and boxplot() also have an argument `outline' to suppress
	outlier drawing {S-PLUS compatibly}.

    o	New capabilities() options "GNOME" and "IEEE754".

    o	New function casefold(), a wrapper for tolower/toupper
	provided for compatibility with S-PLUS.

    o	contour() is now generic.

    o	cor.test() in package ctest now also gives an asymptotic
	confidence interval for the Pearson product moment correlation
	coefficient.

    o	data(), demo() and library() now also return the information
	about available data sets, demos or packages.  Similarly,
	help.search() returns its results.

    o	density() allows `bw' or `width' to specify a rule to choose the
	bandwidth, and rules "nrd0" (the previous default), "nrd",
	"ucv", "bcv", "SJ-ste" and "SJ-dpi" are supplied (based on
	functions in package MASS).

    o	df.residual() now has a default method, used for classes
	"lm" and "glm".

    o	New argument `cacheOK' to download.file() to request cache
	flushing.

	All methods for download.file() do tilde-expansion on the path
	name.

	The internal download.file() etc now allow URLs of the form
	ftp://user at foo.bar/ and ftp://user:pass at foo.bar/

    o	duplicated() and unique() are now generic functions with
	methods for data frames (as well as atomic vectors).

    o	factanal() and princomp() use napredict() on their scores, so
	na.action = na.exclude is supported.

    o	Function getNativeSymbolInfo() returns details about a native
	routine, potentially including its address, the library in
	which it is located, the interface by which it can be called
	and the number of parameters.

    o	Functions such as help() which perform library or package index
	searches now use NULL as default for their `lib.loc' argument so
	that missingness can be propagated more easily.	 The default
	corresponds to all currently known libraries as before.

    o	Added function file.rename().

    o	hist.default() allows `breaks' to specify a rule to choose the
	number of classes, and rules "Sturges" (the previous default),
	"Scott" and "FD" (Freedman-Diaconis) are supplied (based on
	package MASS).

    o	Function identical(), a fast and reliable way to test for exact
	equality of two objects.

    o	New generic function is.na<-(), from S4.  This is by default
	equivalent to x[value] <- NA but may differ, e.g. for factors
	where "NA" is a level.

    o	is.xxx reached through do_is are now generic.

    o	La.eigen() and La.svd() have new default methods to use later
	(and often much faster) LAPACK routines.  The difference
	is most noticeable on systems with optimized BLAS libraries.

    o	length() is now generic.

    o	New function .libPaths() for getting or setting the paths to the
	library trees R knows about.  This is still stored in .lib.loc,
	which however should no longer be accessed directly.

    o	Using lm/glm/... with `data' a matrix rather than a data frame
	now gives a specific error message.

    o	loess(), lqs(), nls() and ppr() use the standard NA-handling
	and so support na.action = na.exclude.

    o	mahalanobis() now has a `tol' argument to be passed to solve().

    o	mean() has `data frame' method applying mean column-by-column.
	When applied to non-numeric data mean() now returns NA rather
	than a confusing error message (for compatibility with S4).
	Logicals are still coerced to numeric.

    o	The formula interface to mosaicplot() now allows a contingency
	table as data argument.

    o	new.env() is now internal and allows you to set hashing. Also,
	parent.env() and parent.env<-() are included to provide direct
	access to setting and retrieving environments.

    o	Function nsl() to look up IP addresses of hosts: intended as
	a way to test for internet connectivity.

    o	Ops(), cbind(), diff() and na.omit() methods for time series
	objects moved from package ts to package base.

    o	New option `download.file.method' can be used to set the
	default method for download.file() and functions which use it
	such as update.packages().

    o	order() and sort.list() now implement na.last = FALSE, NA.

    o	Started work on new package management system: packageStatus()
	and friends.

    o	page() has a new `method' argument allowing `method = print'.

    o	png(), jpeg() and bmp() devices now have a `bg' argument to
	set the background color: useful to set "transparent" on png().

    o	Changes to the postscript() device:

	- The symbol font can now be set on a postscript() device, and
	  support has been added for using Computer Modern type-1
	  fonts (including for symbols). (Contributed by Brian D'Urso.)

	- There is now support for URW font families: this will give
	  access to more characters and more appropriate metrics on
	  PostScript devices using URW fonts (such as ghostscript).

	- %%IncludeResource comments have been added to the output.
	  (Contributed by Brian D'Urso.)

    o	predict.ppr() now predicts on `newdata' containing NAs.

    o	princomp() now has a formula interface.

    o	readChar() now returns what is available if fewer characters
	than requested are on the file.

    o	readline() allows up to 256 chars for the prompt.

    o	read.table(), scan() and count.fields() have a new argument
	`comment.char', default `#', that can be used to start
	comments on a line.

    o	New function reg.finalizer() to provide R interface to
	finalization.

    o	reshape() extends reshapeLong, reshapeWide, which are deprecated.

    o	rle() now returns a classed object, has a print method and
	an inverse.

    o	Changes to save() and friends:

	- save() now takes an envir argument for specifying where
	  items to be saved are to be found.

	- A new default format for saved workspaces has been
	  introduced.  This format provides support for some new
	  internal data types, produces smaller save files when saving
	  code, and provides a basis for a more flexible serialization
	  mechanism.

	- Modified `save' internals to improve performance when saving
	  large collections of code.

	- save() and save.image() now take a `version' argument to
	  specify the workspace file-format version to use.  The
	  version used from R 0.99.0 to 1.3.1 is version 1.  The new
	  default format is version 2.	load() can read a version 2
	  saved workspace if it is compressed.

	- save() and save.image() now take a `compress' argument to
	  specify that the saved image should be written using the zlib
	  compression facilities.

	- save.image() now takes an argument `ascii'.

	- save.image() now takes an argument `safe'.  If TRUE, the
	  default, a temporary file is used for creating the saved
	  workspace.  The temporary file is renamed if the save
	  succeeds.  This preserves an existing workspace if the save
	  fails, but at the cost of using extra disk space during the
	  save.

	- save.image() default arguments can be specified in the
	  `save.image.defaults' option.	 These specifications are used
	  when save.image() is called from q() or GUI analogs.


    o	scan() allows unlimited (by R) lengths of input lines, instead
	of a limit of 8190 chars.

    o	smooth.spline() has a new `control.spar' argument and returns
	`lambda' besides `spar'.  spar <= 0 is now valid and allows
	to go more closely towards interpolation (lambda -> 0) than before.
	This also fixes smooth.spline() behavior for "df ~= n - 2". Better
	error messages in several situations.

	Note that spar = 0 is no longer the default and no longer entails
	cross-validation.

    o	stars() has been enhanced; new `mar' argument uses smaller
	mar(gins) by default; further `nrow and `ncol' as S-PLUS,
	`frame.plot', `flip.labels', `lty' and explicit `main', `sub',
	`xlab' and `ylab'.  Note that `colors' has been replaced by
	`col.segments' and there's a new `col.stars'.

	stars() now returns the locations invisibly.

    o	step() is now closer to stepAIC() and so handles a wider range
	of objects (but stepAIC [in MASS] is still more powerful).

    o	symbols() now has automatic xlab and ylab and a main argument
	which eliminates an incorrect warning.	It better checks wrongly
	scaled arguments.

    o	Sys.setlocale() now issues a warning if it fails.

    o	An enhanced function type.convert() is now a documented
	function, rather than just internal to read.table().

    o	warning() allows multiple arguments, following S4's style.

    o	New function with() for evaluating expressions in environments
	constructed from data.

    o	Unix x11() devices can now have a canvas color set, which can
	help to distinguish plotting "white" from plotting
	"transparent".

    o	On Unix, X11(), png() and jpeg() now give informative warnings
	if they fail to open the device.


    o	The startup processing now interprets escapes in the values of
	environment variables set in R_HOME/etc/Renviron in a similar
	way to most shells.

    o	The operator "=" is now allowed as an assignment
	operator in the grammar, for consistency with other languages,
	including recent versions of S-Plus.  Assignments with "=" are
	basically allowed only at top-level and in braced or
	parenthesized expressions, to make famous errors such as
	"if(x=0) 1 else 2" illegal in the grammar.
	(There is a plan to gradually eliminate the underscore as an
	assignment in future versions of R.)

    o	Finalizers can be registered to be run on system exit for both
	reachable and unreachable objects.

    o	integer addition, subtraction, and multiplication now return NA's
	on overflow and issue a warning.

    o	Printing factors with both level "NA" and missing values
	uses `<NA>' for the missing values to distinguish them.

    o	Added an experimental interface for locking environments and
	individual bindings.  Also added support for "active bindings"
	that link a variable to a function (useful for example for linking
	an R variable to an internal C global).

    o	GNOME interface now has separate colours for input and output
	text (like the windows GUI). These can be modified via the
	properties dialogue.

    o	Output from the GNOME console is block buffered for increased
	speed

    o	The GNOME console inherits standard emacs-style keyboard
	shortcuts from the GtkText widget for cursor motion, editing
	and selection.	These have been modified to allow for the prompt
	at the beginning of the command line.

    o	One can register R functions and C routines to be called at the
	end of the successful evaluation of each top-level expression,
	for example to perform auto-saves, update displays, etc. See
	addTaskCallback() and taskCallbackManager(). See
	http://developer.r-project.org/TaskHandlers.pdf.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	.Alias has been removed from all R sources and deprecated.

    o	reshapeLong(), reshapeWide() are deprecated in favour of reshape().

    o	Previously deprecated functions read.table.url(), scan.url(),
	source.url(), httpclient() and parse.dcf() are defunct.
	Method "socket" for download.file() no longer exists.


DOCUMENTATION CHANGES

    o	`Writing R Extensions' has a new chapter on generic/method
	functions.


UTILITIES

    o	New package `tools' for package development and administration
	tools, containing the QA tools checkFF(), codoc() and undoc()
	previously in package base, as well as the following new ones:

	-  checkAssignFuns() for checking whether the final argument of
	   assignment functions in a package is named `value'.

	-  checkDocArgs() for checking whether all arguments shown in
	   \usage of Rd files are documented in the corresponding
	   \arguments.

	-  checkMethods() for checking whether all methods defined in a
	   package have all arguments of their generic.

	-  checkTnF() for finding expressions containing the symbols `T'
	   and `F'.

    o	R CMD Rd2dvi has more convenient defaults for its output file.

    o	R CMD check now also fully checks the Depends field in the
	package DESCRIPTION file.  It also tests for syntax errors in
	the R code, whether all methods in the code have all arguments
	of the corresponding generic, for arguments shown in \usage but
	not documented in \arguments, and whether assignment functions
	have their final argument named `value'.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	arraySubscript and vectorSubscript are now available to package
	users.	All "array-like" packages can use a standard method for
	calculating subscripts.

    o	The C routine type2symbol, similar to type2str, returns a symbol
	corresponding to the type supplied as an argument.

    o	The macro SHLIB_EXT now includes `.', e.g. ".so" or ".dll",
	since the Mac uses "Lib" without a `.'.

    o	New Fortran entry points rwarn() and rexit() for warnings and
	error exits from compiled Fortran code.

    o	A new serialization mechanism is available that can be used to
	serialize R objects to connections or to strings.  This
	mechanism is used for the version 2 save format.  For now,
	only an internal C interface is available.

    o	R_tryEval() added for evaluating expressions from C code with
	errors handled but guaranteed to return to the calling C
	routine. This is used in embedding R in other applications and
	languages.

    o	Support for attach()'ing user-defined tables of variables
	is available and accessed via the RObjectTables package
	currently at http://www.omegahat.org/RObjectTables.


BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed share/perl/massage-examples.pl to detect instances of
	par() at the very start of a line.

    o	Fixed Pearson residuals for glms with non-canonical
	link.(PR#1123). Fixed them again for weights (PR#1175).

    o	Fixed an inconsistency in the evaluation context for on.exit
	expressions between explicit calls to `return' and falling off
	the end returns.

    o	The code in model.matrix.default() handling contrasts was
	assuming a response was present, and so without a response was
	failing to record the contrasts for the first variable if it
	was a factor.

    o	diffinv() could get the time base wrong in some cases.

    o	file.append() was opening all files in text mode: mattered
	on Windows and classic Macintosh. (PR#1085)

    o	f[] <- g  now works for factor f.

    o	substr<-() was misbehaving if the replacement was too short.

    o	The version of `packages.html' generated when building R or
	installing packages had an incorrect link to the style sheet.
	The version used by help.start() was correct. (PR#1090)

    o	rowsum() now gives character (not factor codes) as rownames.
	(PR#1092)

    o	plot.POSIX[cl]t now respect the `xaxt' parameter.

    o	It is now possible to predict from an intercept-only model:
	previously model.matrix.default() objected to a 0-column
	model frame.

    o	c.POSIXct was not setting the right classes in 1.3.x.

    o	cor(*, use = "all.obs") <= 1 is now guaranteed which ensures
	that sqrt(1 - r^2) is always ok in cor.test(). (PR#1099)

    o	anova.glm() had a missing drop=FALSE and so failed for some
	intercept-less models.

    o	predict.arima0() now accepts vector as well as matrix
	`newxreg' arguments.

    o	cbind(d,f) now works for 0-column dataframes. This fixes PR#1102.

    o	plot(ts(0:99), log = "y") now works

    o	method "gnudoit" of bug.report() was incorrectly documented as
	"gnuclient" (PR#1108)

    o	saving with ascii=TRUE mangled backslashes. (PR#1115)

    o	frac(,) {and others} now adds a gap appropriately. (PR#1101)

    o	logLik.lm() now uses the correct "df" (nlme legacy code).

    o	closeAllConnections() works again, and closes all sink() diversions.

    o	sink(type="message") works again.

    o	sink.number was (accidentally) returning the result invisibly.

    o	as.POSIXct("NA") (or ..lt) now work; hence, merge(*, all=TRUE) now
	works with dataframes containing POSIXt date columns.

    o	integer(2^30+1) and similar ones do not segfault anymore but duly
	report allocation errors.

    o	seq(0, 0, 1) now works (PR#1133).

    o	reshapeWide() got it wrong if the "i" factor was not sorted (the
	function is now deprecated since reshape() is there, but the bug
	still needed fixing...)

    o	PR#757 was fixed incorrectly, causing improper subsetting of
	pch etc. in plot.formula().

    o	library() no longer removes environments of functions that are
	not defined in the top-level package scope.  Also, packages
	loaded by require() when sourcing package code are now visible
	in the remaining source evaluations.

    o	names(d) <- v  now works (again) for "dist" objects d. (PR#1129)

    o	Workarounds for problems with incompletely specified date-times
	in strptime() which were seen only on glibc-based systems
	(PR#1155).

    o	promax() was returning the wrong rotation matrix. (PR#1146)

    o	The [pqr]signrank and [pqr]wilcox functions failed to check that
	memory has been allocated (PR#1149), and had (often large)
	memory leaks if interrupted.  They now can be interrupted on
	Windows and MacOS and don't leak memory.

    o	range(numeric(0)) is now c(NA, NA) not NA.

    o	round(x, digits) for digits <= 0 always gives an integral
	answer.	 Previously it might not due to rounding errors in
	fround. (PR#1138/9)

    o	Several memory leaks on interrupting functions have been
	circumvented.  Functions lqs() and mve() can now be
	interrupted on Windows and MacOS.

    o	image() was finding incorrect breakpoints from
	irregularly-spaced midpoints. (PR#1160)

    o	Use fuzz in the 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in package
	ctest to avoid rounding errors (PR#1004, follow-up).

    o	Use exact Hodges-Lehmann estimators for the Wilcoxon tests in
	package ctest (PR#1150).

    o	Arithmetic which coerced types could lose the class
	information, for example `table - real' had a class attribute
	but was not treated as a classed object.

    o	Internal ftp client could crash R under error conditions such
	as failing to parse the URL.

    o	Internal clipping code for circles could attempt to allocate
	a vector of length -1 (related to PR#1174)

    o	The hash function used internally in match(), unique() and
	duplicated() was very inefficient for integers stored as
	numeric, on little-endian chips.  It was failing to hash the
	imaginary part of complex numbers.

    o	fifo() no longer tries to truncate on opening in modes
	including "w". (Caused the fifo example to fail on HP-UX.)

    o	Output over 1024 characters was discarded from the GNOME
	console.

    o	rug() now correctly warns about clipped values also for logarithmic
	axes and has a `quiet' argument for suppressing these (PR#1188).

    o	model.matrix.default was not handling correctly contrasts.arg
	which did not supply a full set of contrasts (PR#1187).

    o	The `width' argument of density() was only compatible with S
	for a Gaussian kernel: now it is compatible in all cases.

    o	The rbinom() C code had a transcription error from the original
	Fortran which led to a small deviation from the intended
	distribution. (PR#1190)

    o	pt(t, , ncp=0) was wrong if t was +/-Inf.

    o	Subsetting grouping factors gave incorrect degrees of freedom
	for some tests in package ctests. (PR#1124)

    o	writeBin() had a memory leak.

    o	qbeta(0.25, 0.143891, 0.05) was (incorrectly) 3e-308. (PR#1201)

    o	Fixed alignment problem in ppr.f on Irix. (PR#1002, 1026)

    o	glm() failed on null binomial models. (PR#1216)

    o	La.svd() with nu = 0 or nv = 0 could fail as the matrix passed
	to DGESVD was not of dimension at least one (it was a vector).

    o	Rownames in xcoef and ycoef of cancor() were wrong if x or y
	was rank-deficient.

    o	lqs() could give warnings if there was an exact fit. (PR#1184)

    o	aov() didn't find free-floating variables for Error() terms when
	called from inside another function

    o	write.table() failed if asked to quote a numerical matrix with
	no row names. (PR#1219)

    o	rlnorm( *, *, sd=0) now returns the mean,
     	rnbinom(*, *, prob=1) gives 0, (PR#1218).

Subject: updates: exactRankTests, mvtnorm and maxstat
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0112191349240.19730-100000@artemis.imbe.med.uni-erlangen.de>



Hi, 

following the release of R-1.4.0, new versions of the packages

	* exactRankTests (0.6-0)

	* mvtnorm (0.5-0)
and 
	* maxstat (0.5-2)

are available on CRAN. Several changes to the user-interfaces were necessary
(improvements, hopefully) and some new features are included, for example

in `exactRankTests':

* one- and two-sample permutation tests are available,

* new interface to `pperm',

* exact Hodges-Lehmann confidence intervals in `wilcox.exact' (PR#1150),

* `perm.test' and `wilcox.exact' are generic and offer a formula interface.

Major contributions came (and come) from Kurt Hornik, he 
is now co-author of `exactRankTests'.

In `mvtnorm':

* `{dr}mvnorm' moved from package `e1071' to `mvtnorm' (thanks to Fritz
  Leisch!),

* `pmv{t}norm' has a slightly new interface: the length of lower, upper and
  mean are recycled to the length of the largest and it is possible to
  specify either the correlation or covariance matrix.

In `maxstat':

* `maxstat.test' is now generic and provides a formula interface as well as a
  print and plot method,

* it depends on mvtnorm-0.5-0 and exactRankTests-0.6-0.

Known bugs were fixed, see the CHANGES file in each of the packages for
details. 

Torsten

Subject: new versions of: lmtest, strucchange, ineq
Message-ID: <3C20FB63.D9933CF1@ci.tuwien.ac.at>


Dear R users,

there are new versions of the following packages on CRAN:
  o lmtest 0.9-0
  o strucchange 0.9-4
  o ineq 0.2-1

Changes/fixes in "lmtest":
There have been several bug fixes and the interfaces to all functions
have been improved such that their use is much more flexible.
Furthermore we have added:   
  - p values for the Durbin-Watson test
  - studentized version of the Breusch-Pagan test
  - flexible specification of the alternative hypothesis of the RESET
test
  - simulated p values for the Harrison-McCabe test
  - data sets with examples

Changes/fixes in "strucchange":
Besides a few minor changes and improvements there is a new fixed
version of the function Fstats(), which provides also computation of F
statistics based on
heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance estimation.

Changes/fixes in "ineq":
The empirical and theoretical Lorenz curves have now their own classes
with
plot- and lines-method. A data set with examples has been added and a
few bugs were fixed.

Debian packages of R-1.4.0 and R-1.4.0-recommended [1] have been uploaded and
are currently available at http://incoming.debian.org.  These will run on any
current "testing" (aka "woody") or "unstable" (aka "sid") distribution. [2]

The next archive installation (around 14:00h Central time tomorrow) will move
these files into the package pool from where they will propagate via the
usual mirror sites.

The build daemons for the non-i386 architectures will then start to
complement the i386 release. We currently have 1.3.1 packages for alpha,
ia64, m68k, powerpc, sparc and s390. We will look into the currently missing
architectures (arm, hppa, mips, mipsel) but some of these do have (or had)
compiler problems which prevent the build process from completing. 

Regards, Dirk

[2] As I upgraded the build process, it becomes somewhat more difficult" to
recompile these packages on a Debian "stable" (aka "potato") release.  Doug
Bates and I will look into this, but cannot promise any ETA.

From ripley at stats.ox.ac.uk  Fri Dec 21 07:13:10 2001
From: ripley at stats.ox.ac.uk (Prof Brian Ripley)
Date: Fri, 21 Dec 2001 06:13:10 +0000 (GMT)
Subject: R 1.4.0 on Windows
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.31.0112210559180.2789-100000@gannet.stats>


(1) We've been unable to contact the maintainer to find out when the
official release of R 1.4.0 on Windows might be available.  As the
holidays shutdown is looming, last night I built a binary distribution
from the released sources and put the SetupR.exe and miniR* versions at
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/

(This has the post-release mgcv_0.6-2.)

This is not the official release, so problem reports to me only, please.
(I'd be interested to hear, but am unlikely to be able to change anything
until 2002.)


(2) The bin/windows/contrib section on CRAN has been updated to include
the 1.4.0 versions of packages.  (On TUWien now, mirrored elsewhere soon.)
This means that update.packages() will pick up the latest versions. Some
of these may not work with rw1031 (VR and grid for sure, maybe others).

Anyone with an earlier version of Mandrake can download the SRPM's and
rebuild them for his own system (a detailed readme file is provided)
and hopefully contribute the binaries.

Get it from ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu in pub.

This contains the base files plus the recommended packages (except rpart,
which does not compile yet).

It is compiled under MacOS X 10.1.2 with the December 2001 version of
the Developer Tools, and with g77 from fink.sourceforge net. It has 
support
for gnome, X11R6, and tcl/tk, and it uses the newest ATLAS from fink. It
has two-level namespaces and has a libR.dylib included.

For R,bin you need on your system (remember to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH,
or --better-- install fink and compile these things yourself)

From: plummer at iarc.fr (Martyn Plummer)
Date: Wed, 26 Dec 2001 11:15:29 +0100 (CET)
Subject: RPM binaries of R 1.4.0 for RedHat/Mandrake/Linuxppc
Message-ID: <XFMail.20011226111529.plummer@iarc.fr>


RPM based binary distributions of R 1.4.0 are avaiable on CRAN for the
following flavours of Linux:

Distribution Version Platform Packager
Red Hat       7.x    intel    Martyn Plummer <plummer at iarc.fr>
Red Hat       7.x    alpha    Naoki Takebayashi <ntakebay at bio.indiana.edu>
Red Hat       6.x    intel    Stephen Eglen <stephen at gnu.org>
Mandrake      8.1    intel    Michele Alzetta <mikalzet at libero.it>
LinuxPPC             ppc      Alex Buerkle <buerkla at uwec.edu>

The RPMS are
R-base:        The base distribution
R-recommended: Recommended packages

Given the recent problems with CRAN being cracked, I would like to
remind you that all of these binary distributions are signed with
gpg by their respective maintainers.  To verify the gpg signature
of an rpm use a command like

rpm --checksig R-base-1.4.0-1.i386.rpm

First you must download the public key of the package maintainer
from a public key server (see the man page for gpg).

Subject: Johnson system
Message-ID: <3C30883B.282449A@echip.com>


With R 1.4.0 the JohnsonFit() function in
SuppDists has been modified to accept a vector of
the first four central moments. Previously the
only obvious option was to input a set of
observations. The most common need for this seems
to be by those who have no data in hand, but want
random values from non standard distributions.
