Subject: R 4.3.3 is released
Message-ID: <C1CC6BFB-4735-4156-82CA-3B17091EF0B0@cbs.dk>

The build system rolled up R-4.3.3.tar.gz and .xz (codename "Angel Food Cake") this morning.

This is a minor update, intended as the wrap-up release for the 4.3.x series. 

This also marks the 6th anniversary of R-1.0.0. (2000-02-29)

The list below details the changes in this release. 

You can get the source code from

https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.3.3.tar.gz
https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.3.3.tar.xz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.


For the R Core Team,

Peter Dalgaard

CHANGES IN R 4.3.3:

  NEW FEATURES:

    * iconv() now fixes up variant encoding names such as "utf8"
      case-insensitively.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * The legacy encoding = "MacRoman" is deprecated in pdf() and
      postscript(): support was incomplete in earlier versions of R.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Arguments are now properly forwarded to methods on S4 generics
      with ... in the middle of their formal arguments. This was broken
      for the case when a method introduced an argument but did not
      include ... in its own formals. Thanks to Herv'e Pag`es for the
      report PR#18538.

    * Some invalid file arguments to pictex(), postscript() and xfig()
      opened a file called NA rather than throw an error.  These
      included postscript(NULL) (which some people expected to work
      like pdf(NULL)).

    * Passing filename = NA to svg(), cairo_pdf(), cairo_ps() or the
      Cairo-based bitmap devices opened a file called NA: it now throws
      an error.

    * quartz(file = NA) opened a file called NA, including when used as
      a Quartz-based bitmap device.  It now gives an error.

    * rank(<long vector>) now works, fixing PR#18617, thanks to Ilia
      Kats.

    * seq.int() did not adequately check its length.out argument.

    * match(<POSIXct>, .) is correct again for differing time zones,
      ditto for "POSIXlt", fixing PR#18618 reported by Bastian Klein.

    * drop.terms(*, dropx = <0-length>) now works, fixing PR#18563 as
      proposed by Mikael Jagan.

    * drop.terms(*) keeps + offset(.) terms when it should, PR#18565,
      and drop.terms() no longer makes up a response, PR#18566, fixing
      both bugs thanks to Mikael Jagan.

    * getS3method("t", "test") no longer finds the t.test() function,
      fixing PR#18627.

    * pdf() and postscript() support for the documented Adobe encodings
      "Greek" and "Cyrilllic" was missing (although the corresponding
      Windows' codepages could be used).

    * Computations of glyph metric information for pdf() and
      postscript() did not take into account that transliteration could
      replace one character by two or more (only seen on macOS 14) and
      typically warned that the information was not known.

    * rank(x) no longer overflows during integer addition, when
      computing rank average for largish but not-yet long vector x,
      fixing PR#18630, thanks to Ilia Kats.

    * list.files() on Windows now returns also files with names longer
      that 260 bytes (the Windows limit is 260 characters).
      Previously, some file names particularly with 'East Asian'
      characters were omitted.

    * cov2cor(<0 x 0>) now works, fixing PR#18423 thanks to Mikael
      Jagan and Elin Waring.

    * cov2cor(<negative diagonal>) and similar now give one warning
      instead of two, with better wording, fixing PR#18424 thanks to
      Mikael Jagan.

    * tools:: startDynamicHelp() now ensures port is in proper range,
      fixing PR#18645.

    * pbeta(x, a,b) is correct now for x=0 or 1 in the boundary cases
      where a or b or both are 0, fixing PR#18672 thanks to Michael
      Fay.

    * pmatch(x, table) for large table, also called for data frame row
      selection, dfrm[nm, ], is now interruptible, fixing PR#18656.

    * predict(<rank-deficient lm>, newdata=*) fix computing of nbasis,
      see Russ Lenth's comment 29 in PR#16158.

    * Added a work-around for a bug in macOS 14.3.1 and higher which
      prevents R plots in the Quartz Cocoa device from updating on
      screen.
