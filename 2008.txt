Subject: R 2.6.2 is released
Message-ID: <47AC3A68.4070807@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.6.2.tar.gz a short while ago.

This is a maintenance release and fixes a number of mostly minor bugs.
See the full list of changes below.

You can get it (in a short while) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.6.2.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.

Here is the relevant bit of the NEWS file:

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.6.2

NEW FEATURES

    o   colnames(DF) is now also fast for large dataframes DF with
        automatic row.names.  Note that the correct usage is
        names(DF).  (PR#10470)

    o   tools::texi2dvi() works around the failure of 'texi2dvi --quiet'
        to be quiet in texinfo 4.11.

    o   On Linux, parallel 32/64-bit installations are supported using
        multilib.

BUG FIXES

    o   A compilation problem on one system where glob was not found
        has been corrected.  (PR#10468)

    o   The "profile.nls" method of plot() was losing the x axis labels.

    o   array() computed the total number of entries in the array before
        coercing the dimensions to integer.  (Reported by Allen McIntosh.)

    o   persp() misreported errors in the y parameter.  (Reported by Allen
        McIntosh.)

    o   source("clipboard", echo=TRUE) and file("clipboard", open="rt")
        gave spurious errors.  (Reported by Fernando Saldanha.)

    o   attributes<-() stripped any existing attributes before checking
        that all elements of the right-hand side had names.

    o   rbinom(n, size, *) gave NaN when 'size > .Machine$integer.max'.

    o   print.summary.lm() is now consistent in the capitalization of
        "R-squared".

    o   confint() misreported on some rank-deficient lm() models.
        (PR#10496)  This could also occur in the default method.

    o   \code{\var{<name>}} was not rendered correctly to latex in Rd
        files for non-alphabetic arguments <name>.

    o   In 2.6.1, curve(*, add=TRUE) used a wrong default 'xlim' when x
        coordinates were logged.

    o   The Java-based search in help.start() now only requires a
        JVM >= 1.4 (2.6.1 accidentally required >= 1.5).

    o   The default method for range() was omitting 'na.rm' for
        non-numeric objects such as those of class "Date".  (PR#10508)

    o   cut(x, breaks=<n>) misbehaved on a constant vector of negative
        values.

    o   bxp(), the plotting engine of boxplot(), no longer plots staple
        ticks multiple times.  (PR#10499)

    o   The automatic detection of the domain for message translation
        was not working correctly for messages in message(), warning()
        and stop() in packages other than 'base'.

    o   The profile.nls() function misbehaved when encountering
        non-convergence of the "port" algorithm.

    o   Under certain rare circumstances in R 2.6.x, log(), round()
        and trunc() could alter their arguments in the caller.  This
        involved passing of empty '...' arguments, and was spotted
        when using apply(x, 2, log).

    o   par() no longer warns unnecessarily when asked to set new=FALSE
        on an unused graphics device.

    o   plot.formula() was not passing on '...' when used with a
        one-sided formula.

        plot.formula() was not accepting expressions for annotations
        passed to title().  (PR#10525)

    o   pchisq(x, df=0, ncp=L) now returns the correct limit exp(-L/2) for
        x=0 and is no longer returning NaN for x > 0, L < 80.  (PR#10551)

    o   Non-ASCII characters were only working correctly in Hershey
        fonts if these were specified by the 'vfont' argument to
        text() and not if specified as a font family.

    o   There were several errors in Hershey$allowed, but the help
        page listed the allowed combinations correctly.

    o   text() no longer attempts to use 'vfont' with an expression
        for 'labels' (it was documented not to work).

    o   fisher.test(simulate.p.value = TRUE) gave incorrect answers
        in some extremely degenerate problems.  (PR#10558)

    o   src/extra/pcre has been updated to PCRE 7.5 (bugfix release).

    o   capture.output() completes an incomplete final line of
        output when file = NULL.  (PR#10534)

    o   capture.output() now returns invisibly if output is written to
        a file/connection.

    o   format.AsIs() did not remove the "AsIs" class and so could go
        into an infinite loop.

    o   summary.mlm() lost the names of the coefficients when there
        was only one.

    o   Rdconv was not marking examples files with an encoding if
        this was known from the package's DESCRIPTION file.

    o   readChar() from a raw vector was reading a number of bytes,
        not characters.

    o   slotNames() was erroneously treating classes that extend
        "character" as strings.

    o   R no longer ignores SIGPIPE signals even in processes launched
        by system().  Instead PR#1959 is handled by a simple error
        handler which will give an error message in circumstances
        where none was given before.

    o   The AIC() S4 generic in package stats4 no longer disables
        dispatch of S3 methods for AIC().

    o   The conflicts check in library() excluded all S4 generics, even
        where they were unrelated to the function masked.  It is now
        more selective (although still too generous to S4 generics).

    o   proc.time() was missing a protect and could misbehave if
        provoked by gctorture().  (PR#10600)

    o   The cut() and hist() methods for dates and datetimes are now
        more accurate for intervals of "months" and "years", thanks to
        Marc Schwarz.

    o   url()/download.file() could segfault if the HTTP interaction
        involved a redirect to an address starting with '/' on the
        same server.

    o   Memory allocations used in format() and in an internal utility
        function could be off by one byte. (PR#10635)

    o   isoreg(x, y) no longer segfaults when y has NAs.

    o   split(x, g) always returns a list as documented.  (It used to
        return NULL for a zero-length 'x'.)

    o   tapply(x, g, ...) misbehaved if the args were of zero length.
        (PR#10644)

    o   hist.POSIXt(*, xaxt = "n") no longer suppresses the y-axis.

    o   strptime() crashed under certain locales on Mac OS X.

    o   gregexpr() no longer segfaults when "" is given as the search
        pattern.  Thanks to Herve Pages for the bug report.

    o   matplot(x, *) with default 'pch' did not plot columns from column
        number 37 on (because the default pch was NA for those). (PR#10676)

    o   print.htest() lost output when used within sink(file, split=TRUE).

    o   Setting par(col.main=) also set par("col") to the same colour.

    o   Anonymous fifos were broken (again).

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.7.0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o   The default graphics device in non-interactive use is now
        pdf() rather than postscript().  [PDF viewers are now
        more widely available than PostScript viewers.]

        The default width and height for pdf() and bitmap() have been
        changed to 7 (inches) to match the screen devices.

    o   Most users of the X11() device will see a new device that has
        different fonts, anti-aliasing of lines and fonts and
        supports semi-transparent colours.

    o   Considerable efforts have been made to make the default output
        from graphics devices as similar as possible (and in
        particular close to that from postscript/pdf).  Many devices
        were misinterpreting 'pointsize' in some way, for example as
        being in device units (pixels) rather than in points.

    o   Packages which include graphics devices need to be re-installed
        for this version of R, with recently updated versions.


NEW FEATURES

    o   The apse code used by agrep() has been updated to version
        0.16, with various bug fixes.

        agrep() now supports multibyte character sets.

    o   any() and all() avoid coercing zero-length arguments (which
        used a surprising amount of memory) since they cannot affect
        the answer.

        Coercion of other than integer arguments now gives a warning
        as this is often a mistake (e.g. writing all(pr) > 0 instead
        of all(pr > 0) ).

    o   as.Date(), as.POSIXct() and as.POSIXlt() now convert numeric
        arguments (days or seconds since some epoch) provided the
        'origin' argument is specified.

    o   New function as.octmode() to create objects such as file
        permissions.

    o   as.POSIXlt() is now generic, and it and as.POSIXct() gain a
        '...' argument.  The character/factor methods now accept a
        'format' argument (analogous to that for as.Date).

    o   New function browseVignettes() lists available vignettes in an
        HTML browser with links to PDF, Rnw, and R files.

    o   There are new capabilities "aqua" (for the AQUA GUI and quartz()
        device on Mac OS X) and "cairo" (for cairo-based graphics
        devices).

    o   New function checkNEWS() in package 'tools' that detects common
        errors in NEWS file formatting.

    o   deparse() gains a new argument 'nlines' to limit the number of
        lines of output, and this is used internally to make several
        functions more efficient.

    o   deriv() now knows the derivatives of digamma(x), trigamma(x)
        and psigamma(x, deriv) (wrt to x).

    o   dir.create() has a new argument 'mode', used on Unix-alikes
        (only) to set the permissions on the created directory.

    o   Where an array is dropped to a length-one vector by drop() or
        [, drop = TRUE], the result now has names if exactly one of
        the dimensions was named.  (This is compatible with S.)
        Previously there were no names.

    o   The 'incomparables' argument to duplicated(), unique() and
        match() is now implemented, and passed to match() from merge().

    o   dyn.load() gains a 'DLLpath' argument to specify the path for
        dependent DLLs: currently only used on Windows.

    o   The spreadsheet edit() methods (and used by fix()) for data
        frames and matrices now warn when classes are discarded.

        When editing a data frame, columns of unknown type (that is
        not numeric, logical, character or factor) are now converted
        to character (instead of numeric).

    o   file.create() has a new argument 'showWarnings' (default TRUE)
        to show an informative warning when creation fails, and
        dir.create() warns under more error conditions.

    o   New higher-order functions Find(), Negate() and Position().

    o   [dpqr]gamma(*, shape = 0) now work as limits of 'shape -> 0',
        corresponding to the point distribution with all mass at 0.

    o   An informative warning (in addition to the error message) will
        be given when the basic, extended or perl mode of grep(),
        strsplit() and friends fails to compile the pattern.

    o   More study is done of perl=TRUE patterns in grep() and friends
        when length(x) > 10: this should improve performance on long
        vectors.

    o   grep(), strsplit() and friends with fixed=TRUE or perl=TRUE
        work in UTF-8 and preserve the UTF-8 encoding for UTF-8 inputs
        where supported.

    o   help.search() now builds the database about 3x times faster.

    o   iconv() now accepts "UTF8" on all platforms (many did, but not
        e.g. libiconv as used on Windows).

    o   identity() convenience function to be used for programming.

    o   In addition to warning when 'pkgs' is not found,
        install.packages() now reports if it finds a valid package
        with only a case mismatch in the name.

    o   intToUtf8() now marks the Encoding of its output.

    o   The function is() now works with S3 inheritance; that is, with
        objects having multiple strings in the class attribute.

    o   Extensions to condition number computation for matrices, notably
        complex ones are provided, both in kappa() and the new rcond().

    o   list.file() gains a 'ignore.case' argument, to allow
        case-insensitive matching on some Windows/MacOS file systems.

    o   ls.str() and lsf.str() have slightly changed arguments and
        defaults such that ls.str() {no arguments} works when debugging.

    o   Under Unix, utils::make.packages.html() can now be used directly
        to set up linked HTML help pages, optionally without creating
        the package listing and search database (which can be much
        faster).

    o   new.packages() now knows about the front-end package gnomeGUI
        (which does not install into a library).

    o   optim(*, control = list(...)) now warns when '...' contains
        unexpected names, instead of silently ignoring them.

    o   The options "browser" and "editor" may now be set to functions,
        just as "pager" already could.

    o   packageDescription() makes use of installed metadata where
        available (for speed, e.g. in make.packages.html()).

    o   pairwise.t.test() and pairwise.wilcox.test() now more explicitly
        allow paired tests. In the former case it is now flagged as an
        error if both 'paired' and 'pool.SD' are set TRUE (formerly,
        'paired' was silently ignored), and one-sided tests are generated
        according to 'alternative' also if 'pool.SD' is TRUE.

    o   paste() and file.path() are now completely internal, for speed.
        (This speeds up make.packages.html(packages=FALSE)
        severalfold, for example.)

    o   paste() now sets the encoding on the result under some
        circumstances (see ?paste).

    o   predict.loess() now works when loess() was fitted with
        transformed explanatory variables, e.g, loess(y ~ log(x) + log(z)).

    o   print(<data.frame>)'s new argument 'row.names' allows to suppress
        printing rownames.

    o   print() and str() now also "work" for 'logLik' vectors longer than
        one.

    o   Progress-bar functions txtProgressBar(), tkProgressBar() in
        package tcltk and winProgressBar() (Windows only).

    o   readChar() gains an argument 'useBytes' to allow it to read a
        fixed number of bytes in an MBCS locale.

    o   readNEWS() has been moved to the tools package.

    o   round() and signif() now do internal argument matching if
        supplied with two arguments and at least one is named.

    o   New function showNonASCII() in package tools to aid detection
        of non-ASCII characters in .R and .Rd files.

    o   The [dpq]signrank() functions now typically use considerably
        less memory than previously, thanks to a patch from Ivo
        Ugrina.

    o   spec.ar() now uses frequency(x) when calculating the
        frequencies of the estimated spectrum, so that for monthly
        series the frequencies are now per year (as for spec.pgram)
        rather than per month as before.

    o   spline() gets an 'xout' argument, analogously to approx().

    o   sprintf() now does all the conversions needed in a first pass if
        length(fmt) == 1, and so can be many times faster if called
        with long vector arguments.

    o   [g]sub(useBytes = FALSE) now sets the encoding on changed
        elements of the result when working on an element of known
        encoding.  (This was previously done only for perl = TRUE.)

    o   New function Sys.chmod(), a wrapper for 'chmod' on platforms
        which support it.  (On Windows it handles only the read-only
        bit.)

    o   New function Sys.umask(), a wrapper for 'umask' on platforms
        which support it.

    o   New bindings ttk*() in package tcltk for the 'themed widgets'
        of Tk 8.5.  The tcltk demos make use of these widgets where
        available.

    o   write.table(d, row.names=FALSE) is faster when 'd' has millions of
        rows; in particular for a data frame with automatic row names.
        (Suggestion from Martin Morgan.)


    o   The parser limit on string size has been removed.

    o   If a NEWS file is present in the root of a source package, it
        is installed (analogously to LICENSE, LICENCE and COPYING).

    o   Rd conversion to 'example' now quotes aliases which contain
        spaces.

    o   The handling of DST on dates outside the range 1902-2037 has
        been improved.  Dates after 2037 are assumed to have the same
        DST rules as currently predicted for the 2030's (rather than
        the 1970s), and dates prior to 1902 are assumed to have no DST
        and the same offset as in 1902 (if known, otherwise as in the
        1970s).

    o   On platforms where we can detect that mktime sets errno
        (e.g. Solaris and the code used on Windows but not Linux nor
        Mac OS X), 1969-12-31 23:59:59 GMT is converted from POSIXlt
        to POSIXct as -1 and not NA.

    o   The definition of 'whitespace' used by the parser is slightly
        wider: it includes Unicode space characters on Windows and in
        UTF-8 locales on machines which use Unicode wide characters.

    o   The src/extra/intl sources have been updated to those from
        gettext 0.17.

    o   New flag --interactive on Unix-alikes forces the session to be
        interactive (as --ess does on Windows).

    o   x[<zero-length>] <- NULL is always a no-op: previously
        type-checking was done on the replacement value and so this
        failed, whereas we now assume NULL can be promoted to any
        zero-length vector-like object.

        Other cases of a zero-length index are done more efficiently.

    o   There is a new option in Rd markup of \donttest{} to mark
        example code that should be run by example() but not tested
        (e.g. because it might fail in some locales).

    o   The error handler in the parser now reports line numbers for
        more syntax errors (MBCS and Unicode encoding errors, line
        length and context stack overflows, and mis-specified argument
        lists to functions).

    o   The "MethodsList" objects originally used for method selection
        are being phased out.  New utilities provide simpler
        alternatives (see ?findMethods), and direct use of the mangled
        names for the objects is now deprecated.

    o   Creating new S4 class and method definitions in an environment
        that could not be identified (as package, namespace or global)
        previously generated an error.  It now results in creating and
        using an artificial package name from the current date/time,
        with a warning.  See ?getPackageName.

    o   Unix-alikes now give a warning on startup if locale settings
        fail.  (The Windows port has long done so.)

    o   Parsing and scanning of numerical constants is now done by R's
        own C code.  This ensures cross-platform consistency, and
        mitigates the effects of setting LC_NUMERIC (within base R it
        only applies to output -- packages may differ).

        The format accepted is more general than before and includes
        binary exponents in hexadecimal constants: see
        ?NumericConstants for details.

    o   Dependence specifications for R or packages in the Depends
        field in a DESCRIPTION file can now make use of operators
        < > == and != (in addition to <= and >=): such packages will
        not be installable nor loadable in R < 2.7.0.

        There can be multiple mentions of R or a package in the Depends
        field in a DESCRIPTION file: only the first mention will be
        used in R < 2.7.0.


GRAPHICS CHANGES

    o   The default graphics devices in interactive and
        non-interactive sessions are now configurable via environment
        variables R_INTERACTIVE_DEVICE and R_DEFAULT_DEVICE
        respectively.

    o   New function dev.new() to launch a new copy of the default
        graphics device (and taking care if it is "pdf" or
        "postscript" not to trample on the file of an already running
        copy).

    o   dev.copy2eps() uses dev.displaylist() to detect screen
        devices, rather than list them in the function.

    o   New function dev.copy2pdf(), the analogue of dev.copy2eps().

    o   dev.interactive() no longer treats a graphics device as
        interactive if it has a display list (but devices can still
        register themselves on the list of interactive devices).

    o   The X11() and windows() graphics devices have a new argument
        'title' to set the window title.

    o   X11() now has the defaults for all of its arguments set by the
        new function X11.options(), inter alia replacing options
        "gamma", "colortype" and "X11fonts".

    o   ps.options() now warns on unused option 'append'.

        xfig() no longer takes default arguments from ps.options().
        (This was not documented prior to 2.6.1 patched.)

        pdf() now takes defaults from the new function pdf.options()
        rather that from ps.options() (and the latter was not
        documented prior to 2.6.1 patched).

        The defaults for all arguments other than 'file' in
        postscript() and pdf() can now be set by ps.options() or
        pdf.options()

    o   New functions setEPS() and setPS() as wrappers to ps.options()
        to set appropriate defaults for figures for inclusion in other
        documents and for spooling to a printer respectively.

    o   The meaning of numeric 'pch' has been extended where MBCSes are
        supported.  Now negative integer values indicate Unicode
        points, integer values in 32-127 represent ASCII characters,
        and 128-255 are valid only in single-byte locales.
        (Previously what happened with negative pch values was
        undocumented: they were replaced by the current setting of
        par("pch").)

    o   Graphics devices can say if they can rotate text well
        (e.g. postscript() and pdf() can) and if so the device's
        native text becomes the default for contour labels rather than
        using Hershey fonts.

    o   The setting of the line spacing (par("cra")[2]) on the X11() and
        windows() devices is now comparable with postscript() etc, and
        roughly 20% smaller than before (it used to depend on the
        locale for X11).  (So is the pictex() device, now 20% larger.)
        This affects the margin size in plots, and should result in
        better-looking plots.

    o   There is a per-device setting for whether new frames need
        confirmation.  This is controlled by either par("ask") or
        grid.prompt() and affects all subsequent plots on the device
        using base or grid graphics.

    o   There is a new version of the X11() device based on cairo
        graphics which is selected by type "cairo" or "nbcairo", and
        is available on machines with cairo installed and preferably
        pango (which most machines with gtk+ >= 2.8 will have).  This
        version supports translucent colours and normally does a
        better job of font selection so it has been possible to
        display (e.g.)  English, Polish, Russian and Japanese text on
        a single X11() window.  It is the default where available.

        There is a companion function, savePlot(), to save the current
        plot to a PNG file.

        On Unix-alikes, devices jpeg() and png() also accept
        type = "cairo", and with that option do not need a running
        X server.  The meaning of capabilities("jpeg") and
        capabilities("png") has changed to reflect this.  On MacOS X,
        there is a further type = "quartz".  The default type is
        selected by the new option "bitmapType", and is "quartz" or
        "cairo" where available.

        Where cairo 1.2 or later is supported, there is a svg() device
        to write SVG files, and cairo_pdf() and cairo_ps() devices to
        write (possibly bitmap) PDF and postscript files via cairo.

        Some features require cairo >= 1.2, and some which are
        nominally supported under 1.2 seem to need 1.4 to work well.

    o   There are new bmp() and tiff() devices.

    o   New function devSize() to report the size of the current
        graphics device surface (in inches or device units).  This
        gives the same information as par("din"), but independent of
        the graphics subsystem.

    o   New base graphics function clip() to set the clipping region (in
        user coordinates).

    o   New functions grconvertX() and grconvertY() to convert between
        coordinate systems in base graphics.

    o   identify() recycles its 'labels' argument if necessary.

    o   stripchart() is now a generic function, with default and
        formula methods defined.  Additional graphics parameters may
        be included in the call.  Formula handling is now
        similar to boxplot().

    o   strwidth() and strheight() gain 'font' and 'vfont' arguments and
        accept in-line pars such as 'family' in the same way as text()
        does.  (Longstanding wish of PR#776)

    o   example(ask=TRUE) now applies to grid graphics (e.g. from
        lattice) as well as to base graphics.

    o   Option "device.ask.default" replaces "par.ask.default" now it
        applies also to grid.prompt().

    o   plot.formula() only prompts between plots for interactive
        devices (it used to prompt for all devices).

    o   When plot.default() is called with y=NULL it now calls Axis()
        with the 'y' it constructs rather than use the default axis.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   In package installation, SaveImage: yes is defunct and
        lazyloading is attempted instead.

    o   $ on an atomic vector or S4 object is now defunct.

    o   Partial matching in [[ is now only performed if explicitly
        requested (by exact=FALSE or exact=NA).

    o   Command-line completion has been moved from package 'rcompgen'
        to package 'utils': the former no longer exists as a separate
        package in the R distribution.

    o   The S4 pseudo-classes "single" and double have been removed.
        (The S4 class for a REALSXP is "numeric": for back-compatibility
        as(x, "double") coerces to "numeric".)

    o   gpar(gamma=) in the grid package is now defunct.

    o   Several S4 class definition utilities, get*(), have been said
        to be deprecated since R 1.8.0; these are now formally deprecated.
        Ditto for removeMethodsObject().

    o   Use of the graphics headers Rgraphics.h and Rdevices.h is
        deprecated, and these will be unavailable in R 2.8.0.
        (They are hardly used except in graphics devices, for which
        there is an updated API in this version of R.)

    o   options("par.ask.default") is deprecated in favour of
        "device.ask.default".

    o   The 'device-independent' family "symbol" is deprecated as it was
        highly locale- and device-dependent (it only did something
        useful in single-byte locales on most devices) and font=5
        (base) or fontface=5 (grid) did the job it was intended to do
        more reliably.

    o   gammaCody() is now formally deprecated.

    o   Two low-level functions using MethodsList metadata objects
        (mlistMetaName() and getAllMethods()) are deprecated.

    o   Setting par(gamma=) is now deprecated, and the windows()
        device (the only known example) no longer allows it.

    o   The C macro 'allocString' will be removed in 2.8.0 -- use
        'mkChar', or 'allocVector' directly if really necessary.


INSTALLATION

    o   Tcl/Tk >= 8.3 (released in 2000) is now required to build
        package tcltk.

    o   configure first tries TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC and TK_INCLUDE_SPEC
        when looking for Tcl/Tk headers.  (The existing scheme did
        not work for the ActiveTcl package on Mac OS X.)

    o   The Windows build only supports Windows 2000 or later (XP,
        Vista, Server 2003 and Server 2008).

    o   New option --enable-R-static-lib installs libR.a which can
        be linked to a front-end via 'R CMD config --ldflags'.
        The tests/Embedding examples now work with a static R
        library.

    o   Netscape (which was discontinued in Feb 2008) is no longer
        considered when selecting a browser.

    o   xdg-open (the freedesktop.org interface to
        kfmclient/gnome-open/...) is considered as a possible browser,
        after real browsers such as firefox, mozilla and opera.

    o   The search for tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh now only looks in
        directories with names containing $(LIBnn) in the hope of
        finding the version for the appropriate architecture
        (e.g. x86_64 or i386).

    o   libtool has been updated to version 2.2.

    o   Use of --with-system-zlib, --with-system-bzlib or
        --with-system-pcre now requires version >= 1.2.3, 1.0.5, 7.6
        respectively, for security.


UTILITIES

    o   Rdconv now removes empty sections including alias and keyword
        entries, with a note.

    o   Keyword entries are no longer mandatory in Rd files.

    o   R CMD INSTALL now also installs tangled versions of all vignettes.

    o   R CMD check now warns if spaces or non-ASCII characters are
        used in file paths, since these are not in general portable.

    o   R CMD check (via massage-examples.pl) now checks all examples
        with a 7 inch square device region on A4 paper, for
        locale-independence and to be similar to viewing examples on
        an on-screen device.

        If a package declares an encoding in the DESCRIPTION file,
        the examples are assumed to be in that encoding when running
        the tests. (This avoids errors in running latin1 examples in a
        UTF-8 locale.)

    o   R CMD check uses pdflatex (if available) to check the typeset
        version of the manual, producing PDF rather than DVI.  (This
        is a better check since the package reference manuals on CRAN
        are in PDF.)

    o   R CMD Rd2dvi gains a --encoding argument to be passed to
        R CMD Rdconv, to set the default encoding for conversions.
        If this is not supplied and the files are package sources and
        the DESCRIPTION file contains an Encoding field, that is used
        for the default encoding.

    o   available.packages() (and hence install.packages() etc) now
        supports subdirectories in a repository, and
        tools::write_PACKAGES() can now produce PACKAGES files
        including subdirectories.

    o   The default for 'stylepath' in Sweave's (default) RweaveLatex
        driver can be set by the environment variable
        SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT: see ?RweaveLatex.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o   Both the Unix and Windows interfaces for embedding now make
        use of 'const char *' declarations where appropriate.

    o   Rprintf() and REprintf() now use 'const char *' for their format
        argument -- this should reduce warnings when called from C++.

    o   There is a new description of the interface for graphics
        devices in the 'R Internals' manual, and several new entry
        points.  The API has been updated to version R_GE_version = 5,
        and graphics devices will need to be updated accordingly.

    o   Graphics devices can now select to be sent text in UTF-8, even
        if the current locale is not UTF-8 (and so enable text entered
        in UTF-8 to be plotted).  This is used by postscript(), pdf()
        and the windows() family of devices, as well as the new
        cairo-based devices.

    o   More Lapack routines are available (and declared in R_Ext/Lapack.h),
        notably for (reciprocal) condition number estimation of complex
        matrices.

    o   Experimental utility R_has_slot supplementing R_do_slot.

    o   There is a new public interface to the encoding info stored on
        CHARSXPs, getCharCE and mkCharCE using the enumeration type
        cetype_t.

    o   A new header 'R_ext/Visibility.h' contains some definitions for
        controlling the visibility of entry points, and how to control
        visibility is now documented in 'Writing R Extensions'.


BUG FIXES

    o   pt(x, df) is now even more accurate in some cases (e.g. 12 instead
        of 8 significant digits), when x^2 << df, thanks to a remark from
        Ian Smith, related to PR#9945.

    o   co[rv](use = "complete.obs") now always gives an error if there
        are no complete cases: they used to give NA if
        method = "pearson" but an error for the other two methods.
        (Note that this is pretty arbitrary, but zero-length vectors
        always give an error so it is at least consistent.)

        cor(use="pair") used to give diagonal 1 even if the variable
        was completely missing for the rank methods but NA for the
        Pearson method: it now gives NA in all cases.

        cor(use="pair") for the rank methods gave a matrix result with
        dimensions > 0 even if one of the inputs had 0 columns.

    o   Supplying edit.row.names = TRUE when editing a matrix without
        row names is now an error and not a segfault. (PR#10500)

    o   The error handler in the parser reported unexpected
        & as && and | as ||.

    o   ps.options(reset = TRUE) had not reset for a long time.

    o   paste() and file.path() no longer allow NA_character_ for
        their 'sep' and 'collapse' arguments.

    o   by() failed for 1-column matrices and dataframes.  (PR#10506)
        However, to preserve the old behaviour, the default method
        when operating on a vector still passes subsets of the vector
        to FUN, and this is now documented.

    o   Better behaviour of str.default() for non-default
        'strict.width' (it was calling str() rather than str.default()
        internally); also, more useful handling of options("str").

    o   wilcox.test(exact=FALSE, conf.int=TRUE) could fail in some
        extreme two-sample problems.  (Reported by Wolfgang Huber.)

    o   par(pch=) would accept a multi-byte string but only use the
        first byte.  This would lead to incorrect results in an MBCS
        locale if a non-ASCII character was supplied.

    o   There are some checks for valid C-style formats in, e.g.
        png(filename=).  (PR#10571)

    o   vector() was misinterpreting some double 'length' values, e.g,
        NaN and NA_real_ were interpreted as zero.  Also, invalid
        types of 'length' were interpreted as -1 and hence reported as
        negative.  (length<- shared the code and hence the same
        misinterpretations.)

    o   A basic class "S4" was added to correspond to the "S4" object
        type, so that objects with this type will print, etc.  The
        class is VIRTUAL, since all actual S4 objects must have a real
        class.

    o   Classes with no slots that contain only VIRTUAL classes are now
        VIRTUAL, as was intended but confused by having an empty S4
        object as prototype. ## backed out temporarily ##

    o   format.AsIs() discarded dimnames, causing dataframes with matrix
        variables to be printed without using the column names, unlike
        what happens in S-PLUS (Tim Hesterberg, PR#10730).

    o   xspline() and grid::grid.xspline() work in device coordinates
        and now correct for anisotropy in the device coordinate
        system.

    o   grid.locator() now indicates to the graphics device that it is
        is in 'graphics input' mode (as locator() and identify()
        always have).  This means that devices can now indicate the
        'graphics input' mode by e.g. a change of cursor.

    o   Locales without encoding specification and non-UTF-8 locales
        now work properly on Mac OS X.  Note that locales without
        encoding specification always use UTF-8 encoding in Mac OS X
        (except for specials "POSIX" and "C") - this is different from
        other operating systems.

    o   iconv() now correctly handles to="" and from="" on Mac OS X.

    o   In diag()'s argument list, drop the explicit default (' = n')
        for 'ncol' which is ugly when making diag() generic.

    o   S4 classes with the same name from different packages were not
        recognized because of a bug in caching the new definition.

    o   jpeg() and png() no longer maintain a display list, as they
        are not interactive devices.

    o   Using attr(x, "names") <- value (instead of the correct
        names<-) with 'value' a pairlist (instead of the correct
        character vector) worked incorrectly.  (PR#10807)

    o   Using [<- to add a column to a data frame dropped other
        attributes whereas [[<- and $<- did not: now all preserve
        attributes.  (PR#10873)

    o   File access functions such as file.exists(), file.info(),
        dirname() and unlink() now treat an NA filename as a
        non-existent file and not the file "NA".

    o   r<foo>(), the random number generators, are now more consistent
        in warning when NA's (specifically NaN's) are generated.

    o   rnorm(n, mu = Inf) now returns rep(Inf, n) instead of NaN;
        similar changes are applied to rlnorm(), rexp(), etc.

    o   [l]choose() now warns when rounding non-integer 'k' instead of
        doing so silently.  (May help confused users such as PR#10766.)

    o   gamma() was warning incorrectly for most negative values as being
        too near a negative integer.  This also affected other
        functions making use of its C-level implementation.

    o   dumpMethod() and dumpMethods() now work again.

    o   package.skeleton() now also works for code_files with only
        metadata (e.g. S4 setClass) definitions; it handles S4 classes and
        methods, producing documentation and NAMESPACE exports if requested.

    o   Some methods package utilities (implicitGeneric(), makeGeneric())
        will be more robust in dealing with primitive functions (not a
        useful idea to call them with primitives, though)

    o   Making a MethodsList from a function with no methods table will
        return an empty list, rather than cause an error (questionably
        a bug, but caused some obscure failures).

    o   setAs() now catches 2 arguments in the method definition, if
        they do not match the arguments of coerce().

    o   S4 methods with missing arguments in the definition are handled
        correctly  when non-signature arguments exist, and check for
        conflicting local names in the method definition.

    o   qgamma() and qchisq() could be inaccurate for small p,
        e.g. qgamma(1.2e-10, shape = 19) was 2.52 rather than 2.73.

    o   dbeta(.., ncp) is now more accurate for large ncp, and typically no
        longer underflows for give.log = TRUE.

    o   coerce() is now a proper S4 object and so prints correctly.

    o   @ now checks it is being applied to an S4 object, and if not
        gives a warning (which will become an error in 2.8.0).

    o   dump() and friends now warn that all S4 objects (even those
        based on vectors) are not source()able, with a stronger wording.

    o   read.dcf(all = TRUE) was leaking connections.

    o   scan() with a non-default separator could skip nul bytes,
        including those entered as \0 with allowEscapes=TRUE.  This
        was different from the default separator.

    o   determinant(matrix(,0,0)) now returns a correct "det" result;
        also value 1 or 0 depending on 'logarithm', rather than numeric(0).

    o   Name space 'grDevices' was not unloading its DLL when the
        name space was unloaded.

    o   getNativeSymbolInfo() was unaware of non-registered Fortran
        names, because one of the C support routines ignored them.

    o   load() again reads correctly character strings with embedded nuls.
        (This was broken in 2.6.x, but worked in earlier versions.)


                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.6.2 patched


BUG FIXES

    o   src/extra/pcre has been updated to PCRE 7.6 (bugfix release).

    o   unlink(..., recursive=TRUE) no longer crashes on some platforms
        if a directory cannot be opened.

    o   Loading in 2.6.2 a saved workspace could give an unimportant
        warning in a non-UTF-8 multibyte locale (in particular a CJK
        locale on Windows) which is now suppressed.

    o   print() methods are more consistent in returning the original
        argument invisibly.

    o   Using the X11 data editor (e.g. via edit(), fix() or View())
        could crash if the 'End' key was used and all the columns
        would have fitted into the window.

    o   Creating a new page on an X11() device (by plot.new() or
        grid.newpage()) did not flush out the XClearWindow call, so
        the X11 window might not be refreshed immediately.

    o   libtool has been updated to version 1.5.26, which avoids
        many spurious configure warnings on Darwin/Mac OS X.

    o   l10n_info() now recognizes how Darwin/Mac OS X reports
        Latin-1 locales (as charset ISO8859-1 rather than ISO-8859-1).

    o   Checking examples which used grid (e.g. via lattice) without
        attaching grid no longer give errors from grid_plot_hook().

    o   kappa(m, exact=TRUE) no longer wrongly uses 'exact=FALSE' when m
        is an 'lm' or 'qr' object because the kappa.tri(x, exact=TRUE)
        now works correctly.

    o   help(topic, offline=TRUE) misbehaved when there were multiple
        matches to 'topic'.  (PR#10859)

    o   The 'multilib' changes on Linux broke the use of
        sub-architectures without a main architecture.

    o   source(echo=TRUE) would skip lines consisting entirely of the
        letter t. (PR#10923)

    o   bzip2 has been updated to 1.0.5 (security fix).

Subject: R 2.7.1 is released
Message-ID: <485F5867.4020108@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.7.1.tar.gz a short while ago.

This is a maintenance release and fixes a number of mostly minor bugs
and platform issues.
Notably, the numeric interpretation of "-", "+", and "." has reverted to
pre-2.7.0 behaviour

See the full list of changes below.

You can get it (in a short while) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.7.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.

Here is the relevant bit of the NEWS file:

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.7.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   tools::texi2dvi() has a new argument 'texinputs' to allow the
        TeX and bibtex input paths to be specified (even on MiKTeX).

    o   dev.copy2pdf() gains an 'out.type' argument to allow it to be
        used with cairo_pdf() or quartz(type = "pdf").

    o   poly() has additional checks against user error (as in PR#11243).

    o   The Mac OS quartz() device draws contiguous lines much faster.

    o   A field containing just a sign is no longer regarded as numeric
        (it was on all platforms in 2.7.0, but not on most in earlier
        versions of R).  Similarly, '.' is now always non-numeric.

    o   CITATION files are now read in Latin-1: quite a few were
        failing if used in a multibyte locale such as UTF-8.

    o   The DESCRIPTION file of a package can specify an 'OS_type' field
        as either 'unix' or 'windows' to confine installation to that
        OS type.

    o   HoltWinters() now uses optimize() rather than optim for
        one-parameter problems which should be more reliable (PR#11469).

    o   axis() now respects the setting of par("xpd") when clipping.

    o   The 'factor' method of format() now preserves names, dims and
        dimnames in the same way as for character and numeric inputs.
        (PR#11512)

    o   read.DIF(*, transpose=TRUE) now allows to correctly read DIF files
        produced by some versions of Excel.

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   The use of unserialize() on character strings is deprecated:
        that was a format used in R < 2.4.0.

    o   The use of embedded nuls in character strings is deprecated:
        They will no longer be allowed in R 2.8.0.

UTILITIES

    o   R CMD check checks for possible check directories in the
        sources -- in mid-2008 there were about 20 examples on CRAN.

    o   R CMD build tries harder to clean up the inst/doc directory
        from the remnants of earlier builds.

        It also removes any directories with extension .Rcheck, and
        files .DS_Store and ._* (created by tar on Mac OS X under some
        circumstances: it now sets environment variables to ask for
        such files not to be created by that tar.)

BUG FIXES

    o   Encoding<- on NA_character_ converted it to "NA".

    o   Adobe Symbol was missing from the encodings in
        tools::charset_to_Unicode.

    o   diag(matrix(x, 0, 0)) now returns a 0-length vector of the
        correct mode, instead of always numeric.

    o   The parser sometimes accepted invalid quoted strings in a UTF-8
        locale.

    o   plot.default(x, y) now dispatches to Axis() methods whether
        y is NULL or not.

    o   On Mac OS X, the Cocoa Quartz window could close without warning
        under certain circumstances (specific autorelease pool flush).

    o   Plotting symbols with separate border and fill colours (e.g.,
        plot(pch = 21)) now works with transparent 'col', but opaque
        or semi-transparent 'bg'.  Previously, if 'col' was
        transparent then 'bg' was ignored and nothing was drawn.

    o   file.path() did not work correctly in 2.7.0 if the components
        had different encodings.

    o   merge() failed if there were no common columns and one of the
        inputs had zero rows.

    o   expand.grid() failed if an input had length 0.

    o   match() does again truncate strings at embedded nuls (as newly
        documented in 2.7.0).

    o   Because of a typo, 'pointsize' in png(type="cairo") (and jpeg,
        bmp, tiff) devices was being interpreted in pixels not bigpoints.

    o   is() was wrong for some S3 class objects with class of length
        greater than one.

    o   undoc() / codoc() were not checking all S4 methods in some cases.

    o   Use of textConnection(NULL, mode="w") could segfault.

    o   Use of strwidth/height(units="user") (the default) is again an
        error before a user coordinate system has been set on the
        device, rather than giving nonsensical values (the effect of
        r31367).

    o   Rare string width calculations in package grid were not
        interpreting the string encoding correctly.

    o   hasMethods(f, env) {without specified 'package'} now works better.

    o   A missing PROTECT could cause segfaults on string
        comparisons.  (PR#11421)

    o   str(structure(1, classID = "Pooh")) now works fine.

    o   A missing PROTECT could cause segfaults in if() if coercion of
        the condition was required or a warning was to be given.

    o   plot(<table>) now uses a sensible default main title.

    o   validObject() called with complete=TRUE did not use inherited
        validity methods for slot classes.

    o   Several bugs fixed in as(): the initial method lookup was not
        using the table with inherited methods (so inheritance had to
        be recomputed each time); coerce() should not be called
        directly--it can insert invalid inherited methods; the
        constructed as() methods were not retaining the function's
        environment.

    o   influence.measures(<glm-object>) now computes the same
        Cook's distance approximations as cooks.distance().

    o   plot(<glm>, which=5) uses more correct Cook's distance contours;
        (fix to fix to PR#9316).

    o   pdf() and postscript() were not working correctly in 2.7.0 with
        UTF-8 encoded data in a non-UTF-8 MBCS (e.g. EUC-JP on Unix,
        CJK locales on Windows).

    o   conformMethod(), called by setMethod(), now checks better about
        argument names in wrong order.  Whereas it only warns currently,
        it is planned to become an error in the future.

    o   The predict() method for prcomp() had an incorrect check for
        the number of columns of 'newdata' if the columns were not named.

    o   The axis() function now distinguishes between setting "at" to
        NULL or a zero-length vector, treating the latter as a request
        for no ticks.  This corrects the handling of the "x" parameter
        to rug().

    o   glob2rx("*[*") now produces a correct regular expression.

    o   The canvas is no longer painted on copy or save in Cocoa Quartz.

    o   identify() in Quartz can now be terminated by either using popup
        menu equivalent (Ctrl-click or second mouse button) or by pressing
        the <Esc> key. The latter was documented but did not work.

    o   tools:::.check_package_depends() {called from 'R CMD check'} now
        also works correctly when directory-name != package-name.

    o   Source references were sometimes off by a line.

    o   The quartz() parameter 'antialias' is no longer ignored.

    o   The Quartz device is now trying hard to remove anti-aliasing
        effects for rasterized backends in plots that use adjacent,
        borderless rectangles such as image().

    o   The srcfilecopy() function now adds a timestamp to the object it
        creates.

    o   parse() would lose a token when run on stdin().

    o   socketConnection() was using internally the class "socket"
        and not "sockconn", which caused a conflict with make.socket().
        (PR#11515)

    o   Quartz is now trying harder to find the proper font for a given
        family which resolves font issues on Mac OS X 10.4. Full font
        names and PostScript names can be used interchangeably. (Note,
        however that italic/oblique font faces of Helvetica are not
        included in the Mac OS X 10.4 system).

    o   qf() no longer gives NaN when one of df1 and df2 is large and
        the other is infinite (including if both are infinite); it is more
        accurate e.g. for qf(1e-18, 2,4).

    o   qbeta(-1e10, 50, 40, log.p=TRUE) no longer hangs.

    o   Cocoa Quartz backend autodetection of display DPI was not
        correct for screens rotated by 90 or 270 degrees.

    o   selectMethod("coerce", .) now uses a correct default for
        'useInherited', and hence no longer may mess up the method cache.

    o   show() now also works on "unregistered" S3 class objects.

    o   formatC(*, format="fg", flag="#") is no longer dropping trailing
        zeros.

    o   read.table(file = stdin()) with invalid input could leave the
        connection in an invalid state and hence cause a later
        segfault.  (PR#11627)

    o   read.DIF() did not obey the default 'stringsAsFactors = TRUE'.

    o   The 'noquote' method for c() now works correctly with three or
        more arguments.

    o   symbol() in plotmath expressions works again with non-ASCII
        input on devices that use UTF-8 for the symbol font.

Subject: Forthcoming R Conferences
Message-ID: <18606.34734.358781.844169@lxh5.stat.uni-muenchen.de>



Dear useRs and developeRs,

I hope all attending useR! in Dortmund last week had as much a good
time as I had and a safe trip home. This email is to announce our
plans for forthcoming conferences. In 2009 there will be a useR! in
Rennes, France (July 8-10), directly followed by a DSC in Copenhagen,
Denmark (July 13-14).

We would like to have a useR! 2010 in North America, and 2011 in
Europe. Locations for 2010 and 2011 have not been fixed yet, but there
are already some plans.  Proposals to host a conference are of course
more than welcome.

There have also been questions why 2009 is again in Europe. The main
reasons were:

a) we had a very good offer from Rennes, and (and at least almost one
   year ago, when planning started) none from outside Europe

b) Having European useR!s in odd years will make it easier to set a
   date: in even years there are the biannual Compstat conferences,
   which together with all their satellite meetings block mid-August
   to the beginning of September. In odd years on the other hand,
   there is no regular big conference on computational statistics in
   Europe.

So the basic plan is to be in Europe in odd years, and North America
in even years from now on. Either continent could of course be
replaced by one of the other 5 continents if we get a good
offer. Antarctica may be hard to get to, though ;-)

On behalf of the R Foundation,
Fritz Leisch

Here is the relevant bit of the NEWS file:

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.7.2


NEW FEATURES

    o	sprintf() returns elements of the result in UTF-8 when the
	format or any character input has a corresponding element
	declared as UTF-8.  Similarly for paste(), elements of the
	result are in UTF-8 when any input to that element is declared
	as UTF-8.

    o	axis() has new arguments 'col.ticks' and 'lwd.ticks' to allow
	the colour and line width of ticks to be set separately from
	that of the line (e.g. to set one or the other to transparent
	or zero width).

    o	legend() has a new argument 'box.col' to set the colour of the
	enclosing box.

    o	legend() gains a 'xpd' argument to make it easier to place a
	legend in the margins or outer margins.

    o	stripchart() now passes '...' to title() (as well as to
	plot.default() and axis()). (Wish of PR#12202)

    o	help.search() has new argument 'searchEngine' to go
	directly to the search form: this is needed by users of
	Firefox 3 to workaround a bug in interpreting the search
	results pages.


BUG FIXES

    o	Plotmath computed the glyph metrics for the wrong character (and
	perhaps for a non-existent one) if this was a single-byte
	character with the top bit set.  An example was	symbol("\300").

    o	sink() and cat() could divert output to a non-writable connection.

    o	phyper(x, 0,0,0) no longer hangs for huge x and gives 1 for x >= 0.
	(PR#11813)

    o	plnorm(x, ..., log.p=TRUE) is now correct for x <= 0. (PR#11867)

    o	<data.frame>[, ch] gives an error (again!) when ch is a string not
	exactly matching the column names, thanks to an oral bug report by
	Matthew Dowle.

    o	data.frame(x=1:2, y=3:4, row.names=c("a","NA"))[c(2,NA),] has
	correct row names c("NA,"NA.1") again.

    o	The GUI data editor for dataframes did not handle escape
	characters in entries properly. (PR#11897)

    o	PCRE has been updated to 7.7 (bugfix release).

    o	package.skeleton() wrongly warned about invalid code_files names
	when these were not in the current directory.

    o	shapiro.test(c(0,0,1)) now has P value >= 0 (instead of barely
	negative).

    o	assign() now warns if given a character vector of length > 1,
	rather than silently taking the first element.

    o	rcond(<exactly singular matrix>) now gives 0 instead of an error.

    o	There was a memory leak in C function ucstoutf8 used by some
	graphics devices.

    o	Plots of profile.mle() objects (package 'stats4') were
	misbehaving when the 'which' argument had been used in their
	calculation.

    o	dnbinom(x, size, mu=*, ..) is now more accurate for very large
	'size'.  The same applies to pnbinom() and rnbinom().

    o	axis() was ignoring par() mgp[3] if mgp was set in-line.

    o	Closing an X11 View() or dataentry window via its frame's
	close control now works better on some window managers.

    o	Calling lapply() was not handling method dispatch correctly for
	is.numeric(), is.matrix(), is.array(), log() and the Math2
	group.  This affected data.matrix() which incorrectly regarded
	"Date" and "POSIXct" objects as numeric, and has been adjusted
	to do so as exceptions.

    o	package.skeleton() was not looking for non-function objects in
    	its 'environment' argument.

    o	nls() was only finding its 'weights' argument in the case when
    	all the variables in the formula were of the same length and
    	hence that model.frame() could be used.

	It was silently ignoring 'subset' and 'na.action' except in
	that case.  Now they are ignored only if 'data' is a list and
	variables taken from 'data' are not all of the same length,
	in which case a warning is given.

    o	The 'mle' confint() method now takes 'level' into account when
	setting 'alpha' for the profile.

    o	within() was not handling correctly expressions that produced
	NULL columns.  (PR#11131)

    o	dev.print() and dev.copy2{eps,pdf}() now ensure that the current
	device is restored as the active device even if an error
	occurs. (PR#9801)

    o	as.Date() could fail to convert character strings representing
	days on which midnight did not exist in the current timezone
	(as happened in parts of Africa on 1960-01-01).

    o	The automatic placement of legend() with 'title' and a
	reversed 'x' axis was incorrect. (PR#12019)

    o	The use of multiple packages in 'LinkingTo' works again, and
    	now works when the dependent packages are in the library to be
    	installed to (but not in the library path seen by R --vanilla).

    o	bxp() (and hence boxplot) now respects in-line graphical
	parameters 'xaxp'/'yaxp' as appropriate.  (PR#11463)

    o	barplot(log = "y") failed if there were NAs in the 'height'
	argument.  (PR#11585)

    o	pbeta() is more accurate in some cases with extreme values of
	'ncp'.  (PR#11277).

    o	edit.data.frame() no longer fails if called on a 0-column
	data frame and no column is created.

    o	pchisq(x, df=0) was always one even for x < 0; similarly for
	pgamma(x, alpha=0).

    o	add1() and drop1() now return a P-value of NaN in cases with
	df=0 for test="Chisq" (they gave NaN until pchisq was altered
	in R 2.6.2).

    o	The default methods of drop1() and add1() now re-evaluate in the
	object's formula environment, rather than simply in the parent
	(informal bug report by Werner Stahel).

    o	The undocumented limit of 8191 bytes on comments (from # to
	the end of the line) in R code has been removed.

    o	qgamma() warns if used with shape < 1e-10, when it may be
 	unreliable.  (PR#12324)

    o	Installing a source package was not using the package's declared
	encoding (if any) as a default encoding for the help.search()
	database in Meta/hsearch.rds.  This could cause packages with
	a default encoding to have some of their entries rejected by
	help.search() in a multi-byte locale (such as a UTF-8 locale).

    o	duplicated() and unique() now handle 'incomparables' better,
    	and avoid occasional segfaults (PR#12551).

    o	data.frame(row.names=NULL) once again behaves differently from
	the default (as documented).

    o	plot(isoreg(x,y)) now plots the points correctly, also when 'x'
	is not sorted.

Subject: R 2.8.0 is released
Message-ID: <48FC5054.5030307@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.8.0.tar.gz a short while ago. This is a development 
release which contains a number of new features.

Also, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it (later today) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.8.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. In case of 
impatience, try http://www.biostat.ku.dk/~pd/R-release

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.8.0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o   var(), cov(), cor(), sd() etc now by default (when 'use' is not
        specified) return NA in many cases where they signalled an
        error before.

NEW FEATURES

    o   abbreviate() gains an optional argument 'strict' allowing cheap
        and fast strict abbrevation.

    o   The "lm" methods of add1(), anova() and drop1() warn if they are
        mis-used on an essentially exact fit.

    o   as.array() is now generic, gains a '...' argument.

    o   New function as.hexmode() for converting integers in hex format.
        format.hexmode() and as.character.hexmode() gain an 'upper.case'
        argument.

    o   bitmap() and dev2bitmap() gain support for anti-aliasing.
        The default type has been changed to 'png16m', which supports
        anti-aliasing.

    o   Box.test() gains a 'fitdf' argument to adjust the degrees of
        freedom if applied to residuals.

    o   browseURL() has a new argument 'encodeIfNeeded' to use
        URLencode() in cases where it seems likely that would be
        helpful.  (Unfortunately, those are hard to guess.)

    o   by() gains a 'simplify' argument, passed to tapply().

    o   capabilities() gains a new argument "tiff" to report if tiff()
        is operational.

    o   chol2inv() now treats <numeric(1)> as a [1 x 1]-matrix.

    o   cov() and cor() have the option 'use = "everything"' as default,
        and so does var() with its default 'na.rm = FALSE'.  This
        returns NA instead of signalling an error for NA observations.
        Another new option is 'use = "na.or.complete"' which is the default
        for var(*, na.rm=FALSE).
        var(double(0), na.rm= L) now returns NA instead of signalling an error,
        for both L = TRUE or FALSE, as one consequence of these changes.

    o   data.matrix() now tries harder to convert non-numeric columns,
        via as.numeric() or as(, "numeric").

    o   dev.interactive() is able to recognize the standard screen
        devices if getOption("device") is a function (as well as by name).

    o   dev.new() gains a '...' argument which can be used to pass
        named arguments which will be used if appropriate to the
        device selected.

    o   dimnames(x) <- value extends 'value' if it a list and too
        short, and 'x' is an array.  This allows constructions such as
        dimnames(x)[[1]] <- 1:3 to work whether or not 'x' already has
        dimnames.

    o   format(), formatC() and prettyNum() gain a new argument
        'drop0trailing' which can be used to suppress trailing "0"s.

    o   format() now works for environments; also print(env) and str(env)
        share the same code for environments.

    o   It is now possible to create and open a text-mode gzfile()
        connection by explicitly using e.g. open="rt".

    o   New help.request() function for compiling an e-mail to R-help
        according to "the rules". It is built on the new utility,
        create.post() on which also bug.report() is based now; both
        thanks to a contribution by Heather Turner.

    o   help.search() now assumes that non-ASCII items are in latin1
        if that makes sense (all known examples on CRAN are).

    o   HoltWinters() and decompose() use a (statistically) more
        efficient computation for seasonal fits (they used to waste
        one period).

    o   intToUtf8() and intToBits() now accept numeric vectors,
        truncating them to integers.

    o   is.unsorted() gains an argument 'strictly'.  It now works for
        classed objects with a >= or > method (as incorrectly
        documented earlier).

    o   library() no longer warns about the masking objects that are
        identical(.,.) to those they mask.

    o   lockBinding(), unlockBinding(), lockEnvironment() and
        makeActiveBinding() now all return invisibly (they always
        return NULL).

    o   mood.test() now behaves better in the presence of ties.

    o   na.action() now works on fits of classes "lm", "glm", ....

    o   optim(.., method="SANN", .., trace=TRUE) is now customizable via
        the 'REPORT' control argument, thanks to code proposals by
        Thomas Petzoldt.

    o   The 'factory-fresh' defaults for options("device") have been
        changed to refer to the devices as functions in the grDevices
        namespace and not as names.  This makes it more likely that
        the incorrect (since R 2.5.0) assumption in packages that
        get(getOption("device"))() will work will catch users of those
        packages.

    o   pch=16 now has no border (for consistency with 15, 17, 18) and
        hence is now different from pch=19.

    o   pdf() has new arguments 'useDingbats' (set this to FALSE for use
        with broken viewers) and 'colormodel'.  It now only references
        the ZapfDingbats font if it is used (for small opaque circles).

        The default PDF version is now 1.4, since viewers that do not
        accept that are now rare.

        Different viewers were rendering consecutive text() calls on a
        pdf() device in different ways where translucency was
        involved.  The PDF generated has been changed to force each
        call to be rendered separately (which is the way xpdf or
        ghostscript was rendering, but Acrobat was forming a
        transparency group), which is consistent with other graphics
        devices supporting semi-transparency.

    o   plot.dendrogram() has new arguments (xlim, ylim) which allows
        zooming into a hiearchical clustering dendrogram.

    o   plot.histogram() gains an 'ann' argument. (Wish from Ben Bolker.)

    o   plot(<lm_obj>) now warns when it omits points with leverage one
        from a plot.

    o   Plotmath now recognizes 'aleph' and 'nabla' (the Adobe Symbol
        'gradient' glyph) as symbol names.

    o   polyroot() no longer has a maximum degree.

    o   The alpha/alphamax argument of the 'nls' and 'mle' profile()
        methods is used to compute confidence limits for univariate
        t-statistics rather than a confidence region for all the
        parameters (and not just those being profiled).

    o   quantile.default() allows 'probs' to stray just beyond [0, 1],
        to allow for computed values.

    o   New functions rawConnection() and rawConnectionValue() allow
        raw vectors to be treated as connections.

    o   read.dcf() now consistently gives an error for malformed DCF.

    o   read.fwf() no longer passes its default for 'as.is' to
        read.table(): this allows the latter's default to be used.

    o   readBin(), writeBin(), readChar() and writeChar() now open a
        connection which was not already open in an appropriate binary
        mode rather than the default mode.

        readLines(), cat() and sink() now open a connection which was
        not already open in an appropriate text mode rather than the
        default mode.

    o   readCitationFile() (and hence citation) now reads a package's
        CITATION file in the package's declared encoding (if there is one).

    o   The behaviour of readLines() for incomplete final lines on
        binary-mode connections has been changed to be like blocking
        rather than non-blocking text-mode connections.

    o   A new reorder.character() method has been added.  This allows
        use of 'reorder(x, ...)' as a shorthand for
        'reorder(factor(x), ...)' when 'x' is a character vector.

    o   round() now computes in long doubles where possible so the
        results are more likely to be correct to representation error.

    o   rug() now uses axis()'s new arguments from 2.7.2, hence no
        longer draws an axis line.

    o   save() (optionally, but by default) checks for the existence
        of objects before opening the file/connections (wish of
        PR#12543).

    o   segments(), arrows() and rect() allow zero-length
        coordinates.  (Wish of PR#11192)

    o   set.seed(kind=NULL) now takes 'kind' from a saved seed if the
        workspace has been restored or .Random.seed has been set in
        some other way.  Previously it took the 'currently used' value,
        which was "default" unless random numbers had been used in
        the current session.  Similarly for the values reported by
        RNGkind().  (Related to PR#12567.)

        set.seed() gains a 'normal.kind' argument.

    o   setEPS() and setPS() gain '...' to allow other arguments to be
        passed to ps.options(), including overriding 'width' and 'height'.

    o   setTimeLimit() function to set limits on the CPU
        and/or elapsed time for each top-level computation, and
        setSessionLimit() to set limits for the rest of the session.

    o   splinefun() has a new method = "monoH.FC" for monotone Hermite
        spline interpolation.

    o   sprintf() optionally supports the %a/%A notation of C99 (if the
        platform does, including under Windows).

    o   str()'s default method gains a 'formatNum' function argument which
        is used for formatting numeric vectors.  Note that this is very
        slightly not backward compatible, and that its default may change
        before release.

    o   The summary() method for class "ecdf" now uses a print()
        method rather than printing directly.

    o   summary.manova() uses a stabler computation of the test
        statistics, and gains a 'tol' argument to allow highly
        correlated responses to be explored (with probable loss of
        accuracy).  Similar changes have been made to anova.mlm() and
        anova.mlmlist().

    o   Sweave() now writes concordance information inside a
        \Sconcordance LaTeX macro, which allows it to be inserted into
        PDF output.

    o   system.time() now uses lazy evaluation rather than
        eval/substitute, which results in more natural scoping. (PR#11169)

    o   In table(), 'exclude=NULL' now does something also for factor
        arguments. A new 'useNA' argument allows you to control
        whether to add NA levels unconditionally or only when present
        in data. A new convenience function addNA() gives similar
        functionality by adding NA levels to individual factors.

    o   unlink() tries the literal pattern if it does not match with
        wildcards interpreted -- this helps with e.g. unlink("a[b")
        which previously needed to be unlink("a\\[b").

    o   update.packages() gains an argument 'oldPkgs', where
        new.packages() and old.packages() get 'instPkgs'.  These allow to
        consider only subsets of packages instead of all installed ones.

    o   which(b) is somewhat faster now, notably for named vectors, thanks
        to a suggestion by Henrik Bengtsson.

    o   New generic function xtfrm() as an auxiliary helper for
        sort(), order() and rank().  This should return a numeric
        vector that sorts in the same way as its input.  The default
        method supports any class with ==, > and is.na() methods but
        specific methods can be much faster.

        As a side-effect, rank() will now work better on classed
        objects, although possibly rather slowly.

    o   X11() and capabilities("X11") now catch some X11 I/O errors that
        previously terminated R.  These were rare and have only be
        seen with a misconfigured X11 setup on some versions of X11.

    o   The handling of nuls in character strings has been changed --
        they are no longer allowed, and attempting to create such a
        string now gives a truncation warning (unless
        options("warnEscapes") is false).

    o   The user environment and profile files can now be specified via
        environment variables 'R_ENVIRON_USER' and 'R_PROFILE_USER',
        respectively.

    o   ?pkg::topic and ?pkg:::topic now find help on 'topic' from
        package 'pkg' (and not help on :: or :::).

    o   ??topic now does help.search("topic"); variations such as
        ??pkg::topic or field??topic are also supported.

    o   There is support for using ICU (International Components for
        Unicode) for collation, enabled by configure option --with-ICU
        on a Unix-alike and by a setting in MkRules on Windows.
        Function icuSetCollate() allows the collation rules (including
        the locale) to be tuned.  [Experimental]

    o   If S4 method dispatch is on and S4 objects are found as
        attributes, show() rather than print() is used to print the
        S4 attributes.

    o   Starting package tcltk without access to Tk (e.g. no available
        display) is now a warning rather than an error, as Tcl
        will still be usable.  (On most platforms it was possible to
        inhibit Tk by not having DISPLAY set, but not on Windows nor
        Mac OS X builds with --with-aqua.)

    o   Using $ on a non-subsettable object (such as a function) is
        now an error (rather than returning NULL).

    o   Hexadecimal numerical constants (such as 0xab.cdp+12) may now
        contain a decimal point.

    o   PCRE has been updated to version 7.8 (mainly bug fixes).

    o   plot.ecdf() now defaults to pch=19 so as to better convey the
        left-closed line segments.

NEW FEATURES IN PACKAGE 'methods'

    o   S3 classes that are registered by a call to setOldClass() now
        have the S3 class as a special slot, and therefore so do
        any S4 classes that contain them.  This mechanism is used to
        support S4 classes that extend S3 classes, to the extent
        possible.  See ?Classes, ?setOldClass, and ?S3Class.

        The treatment of special pseudo-classes "matrix", "array", and
        "ts" as S4 classes has also been modified to be more
        consistent and, within limitations imposed by special
        treatment of these objects in the base code, to allow other
        classes to contain them.  See class?ts.

        A general feature added to implement "ts" and also
        "data.frame" as S4 classes is that an S4 class definition can
        be supplied to setOldClass() when the S3 class has known
        attributes of known class.

        setOldClass() now saves all the S3 inheritance, allowing the
        calls to be built up in stages, rather than including all the
        S3 classes in each call.  Also allows as(x,"S3") to generate
        valid S3 inheritance from the stored definition.  See ?S3.

    o   S4 methods may now be defined corresponding to "...", by
        creating a generic function that has "..." as its signature.
        A method will be selected and called if all the arguments
        matching "..." are from this class or a subclass.  See ?dotsMethods.

    o   New functions S3Part() and S3Class() provide access to the
        corresponding S3 object and class for S4 classes that extend
        either an S3 class or a basic R object type.

    o   show(<class definition>) now also shows the class name.

INSTALLATION

    o   If sub-architectures are used, a copy of Rscript is installed
        in ${R_HOME}/bin/exec${R_ARCH} (since that in ${R_HOME}/bin
        and /usr/bin might be overwritten in a subsequent installation).

PACKAGE INSTALLATION

    o   LazyLoad: yes is now the default, so packages wanting to avoid
        lazy loading must set 'LazyLoad: no' (or an equivalent value) in
        the DESCRIPTION file.

    o   R CMD INSTALL will now fail if it finds a non-executable
        'configure' script in the package -- this usually indicates a
        file system with insufficient permissions.  If a
        non-executable 'cleanup' script is found and either
        --clean or --preclean is used, a warning is given.

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   Use in packages of the graphics headers Rdevices.h and
        Rgraphics.h is defunct: they are no longer installed.

    o   options("par.ask.default") is defunct in favour of
        "device.ask.default".

    o   The 'device-independent' family "symbol" is defunct: use
        font=5 (base) or fontface=5 (grid) instead.

    o   gammaCody() is defunct.

    o   par("gamma") is defunct.

    o   'methods' package functions getAccess(), getAllMethods(),
        getClassName(), getClassPackage(), getExtends(),
        getProperties(), getPrototype(), getSubclasses, getVirtual(),
        mlistMetaName(), removeMethodsObject() and seemsS4Object() are
        defunct.

    o   Use of a non-integer .Random.seed is now an error.  (R itself
        has never generated such values, but user code has, and
        R >= 2.6.0 has given a warning.)

    o   methods::allGenerics() is deprecated.

    o   In package installation, SaveImage: yes is now ignored, and
        any use of the field will give a warning.

    o   unserialize() no longer accepts character strings as input.

    o   The C macro 'allocString' has been removed -- use 'mkChar' and
        variants.

    o   Use of allocVector(CHARSXP ...) is deprecated and gives a warning.

UTILITIES

    o   The default for 'stylepath' in Sweave's (default) RweaveLatex
        driver is now FALSE rather than TRUE if
        SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT is unset : see ?RweaveLatex.
        To support this, tools::texi2dvi adds the R 'texmf' directory
        to the input search path.

    o   R CMD Rd2dvi now previews PDF output (as was documented) if
        R_PDFVIEWER is set (as it will normally be on a Unix-alike but
        not on Windows, where the file association is used by default).

    o   R CMD check checks for binary executable files (which should not
        appear in a source package), using a suitable 'file' if
        available, else by name.

    o   R CMD check now also uses codetools' checks on the body of S4
        methods.

C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o   R_ReadConsole will now be called with a buffer size of 4096
        bytes (rather than 1024): maintainers of alternative
        front-ends should check that they do not have a smaller limit.

    o   Graphics structure NewDevDesc has been renamed to DevDesc.
        For now there is a compatibility define in GraphicsDevice.h,
        but it will be removed in R 2.9.0.

    o   PROTECT and UNPROTECT macros now work even with R_NO_REMAP.

BUG FIXES

    o   @ now gives an error (and not just a warning) if it is being
        applied to a non-S4 object.

    o   R CMD appends (not prepends) R's texmf path to TEXINPUTS.

    o   Objects generated by new() from S4 classes should now all
        satisfy isS4(object).  Previously, prototypes not of object
        type S4 would not be S4 objects.  new() applied to basic,
        non-S4 classes still will (and should) return non-S4 objects.

    o   Functions writing to connections such as writeLines(),
        writeBin(), writeChar(), save(), dput() and dump() now check
        more carefully that the connections are opened for writing,
        including connections that they open themselves.

        Similarly functions which read such as readLines(), scan(),
        dcf() and parse() check connections for being open for reading.

    o   Equality comparison of factors with <NA> levels now works
        correctly again.

    o   Repainting of open X11 View() windows is now done whilst an
        X11 dataentry window is in use.

    o   Indexing of data frames with NA column names and a numeric or
        logical column index works again even if columns with NA names
        are selected.

    o   on.exit() has been fixed to use lexical scope in determining
        where to evaluate the exit action when the on.exit expression
        appears in a function argument.

    o   rank() now consistently returns a double result for
        ties.method = "average" and an integer result otherwise.
        Previously the storage mode depended on 'na.last' and if any
        NAs were present.

    o   The "lm" methods of add1(), and drop1() now also work on a model
        fit with  na.action = na.exclude.

    o   median(c(x = NA_real_)) no longer has spurious names().

    o   isoreg(x, y) now returns the correct result also when x has ties,
        in all cases.

    o   What na.action() does is now correctly documented.

    o   source() with echo=TRUE now behaves like ordinary automatic
        printing, by using methods::show() for S4 objects.

    o   Several bugs fixed in `?` with topics: it previously died trying
        to construct some error messages; for S4 methods, class "ANY"
        should be used for omitted arguments and default methods.

    o   trace() should create missing traceable classes in the global
        environment, not in baseenv() where other classes will not be
        found.

    o   Class inheritance using explicit coerce= methods via setIs()
        failed  to coerce the argument in method dispatch.  With this
        fixed, a mechanism was needed to prohibit such inheritance
        when it would break the generic function (e.g.,
        initialize). See ?setIs and ?setGeneric.

    o   RSiteSearch() encodes its query (it seems this is occasionally
        needed on some platforms, but encoding other fields is harmful).

    o   'incomparables' in match() was looking up indices in the wrong
        table.

    o   write.dcf() did not escape "." according to Debian policy
        (PR#12816).

    o   col2rgb() sometimes opened a graphics device unnecessarily, and
        col2rgb(NA) did not return a transparent color, as documented.

    o   pdf(family="Japan") [and other CIDfonts] no longer seg.faults
        when writing "western" text strings.

    o   as.list() applied to an environment now forces promises and
        returns values.

    o   Promises capturing calls to sys.parent() and friends did not
        work properly when evaluated via method dispatch for internal
        S3 generics.

    o   The default pkgType option for non-CRAN builds of R on Mac OS X
        is now correctly "source" as documented.

    o   The default R_LIBS_USER path in AQUA builds now matches the
        Mac-specifc path used by the Mac GUI: ~/Library/R/x.y/library

    o   splinefun() with natural splines incorrectly evaluated derivatives
        to the left of the first knot. (PR#13132, fix thanks to
        Berwin Turlach)

    o   anova(glm(..., y=FALSE)) now works.  (PR#13098)

    o   cut.Date(x, "weeks") could fail if x has only one unique value
        which fell on a week boundary.  (PR#13159)

The sixth international workshop on 'Distributed Statistical Computing'
(DSC 2009) will take place at the the University of Copenhagen, Denmark,
13th-14th of July 2009. This conference follows on from the successful
DSC 1999, 2001, and 2003 conferences at the Vienna University of
Technology, DSC 2005 at the University of Washington in Seattle, and DSC
2007 at the University of Auckland. The workshop will focus on, but is
not limited to, open source statistical computing and aims to provide a
platform for exchanging ideas about developments in statistical
computing (rather than 'only' the usage of statistical software for
applications).

It is expected that a large proportion of participants will bring a
presentation. We particularly welcome contributions advancing
statistical computing as an independent topic.

Subject: useR!2009 conference announcement
Message-ID: <4936BE10.3010206@agrocampus-ouest.fr>

We are happy to inform you that the online abstract submission and 
registration for `useR! 2009' is now available online from

http://www.R-project.org/useR-2009/

This meeting of the R user community will take place at Agrocampus, 
Rennes, France, July 8 to 10, 2000. The conference schedule comprises 
invited lectures and user-contributed sessions as well as half-day 
tutorials presented by R experts on July 7, 2009, prior to the conference.

Invited speakers will include

Adele Cutler, Peter Dalgaard, Jerome H. Friedman,  Michael Greenacre,  
Trevor Hastie, John Storey, Martin Theus.

The spectrum of user-contributed sessions will depend on your 
submissions. Hence, we invite you to submit abstracts for a talk or a 
poster on topics presenting innovations or exciting applications of R. 
The call for papers along with the link to the online abstract 
submission is available at

http://www.R-project.org/useR-2009/#Call

Before the start of the official program, half-day tutorials will be 
offered on Tuesday, July 7. A list of topics and speakers can be found at

http://www.R-project.org/useR-2009/tutorials/

The deadline for early registration and to submit an abstract is 
February 27th 2009, so now is the perfect time to write and submit an 
abstract, register as a participant and plan your trip to Rennes (Rennes 
will be busy at the conference time because the cultural event `Festival 
Les tomb?es de la nuit' will take place at the same time, so we 
recommend to book as soon as possible). The conference web page

http://www.agrocampus-ouest.fr/math/useR-2009/accomodation.html
gives a list of hotels and some student rooms (200) are also available 
on the campus.

We hope to meet you in Rennes!

Subject: R 2.8.1 is released
Message-ID: <494F5CCB.90203@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.8.1.tar.gz a short while ago.

This is a maintenance release and fixes a number of mostly minor bugs
and platform issues.

See the full list of changes below.

You can get it (in a short while) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.8.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.8.1


NEW FEATURES

     o	sum() now has a method for "difftime" objects (via the Summary
	group).

	max(), min() and range() applied to "difftime" object(s) now
	return a result in the common units of the objects, if there
	is one.

     o	installed.packages() is now tolerant of malformed DESCRIPTION
	files in installed packages (it ignores them, with a warning).

     o	qt() now works for 0 < df < 1.

     o	For consistency with matrix() and array(), dimnames(x) <-
	list() removes the dimnames (as assigning NULL would do).
	It was previously an error.

     o	nlminb() copies names from 'start' to the parameter vector
	used (for consistency with optim()).

     o	legend() gains a 'title.col' argument: the title colour was
	previously set from the first element of 'text.col' (which
	remains the default).

     o	In an Rd file, use of top-level \itemize{} inside a \value{}
	block is unnecessary and almost always gave a faulty
	conversion.  Most cases are now detected and corrected, but
	give a warning as such code will not work correctly in earlier
	versins of R.

	Also, use of \code{} inside a code block such as \examples{}
	will give a erroneous conversion that is now detected and
	warned against.

     o	Autoflushing of stdout is turned on when Rd processing, so
	warnings/error are likely to appear in the right place in
	redirected output (such as that from R CMD check).


UTILITIES

     o	R_PDFLATEXCMD is added to the environment variables set by
     	'R CMD' and is used by R CMD Rd2dvi.

	R_LATEXCMD, R_PDFLATEXCMD, R_MAKEINDEXCMD and R_DVIPSCMD
	default to 'latex', 'pdflatex', 'makeindex' and 'dvips'
	respectively if no suitable executable was found at configure
	time (since they might well be available at run time,
	particularly for binary installations of R).  This affects
	R CMD Rd2dvi and help(offline=TRUE).

	R CMD Rd2dvi now gives an explicit error message if latex (or
	pdflatex) fails.

	R CMD Rd2dvi gains a --no-index argument: processing some
	special characters on PDF indices gave errors which used to be
	ignored.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

     o	R CMD INSTALL --with-package-versions is deprecated (and
	support has always been incomplete on Windows).

	So is install.packages(installWithVers = TRUE).

     o	Rd conversion to Sd and Ssgm is now deprecated as we no longer
	have any means to check the results (and Sd is long obsolete).


BUG FIXES

     o	add1.glm() no longer warns if applied to a binomial glm with a
	factor response.

     o	aggregate.data.frame() now does something sensible with a
	zero-column 'x' rather than failing with an obscure error
	message.  It gives an explicit error message if called with a
	zero-row 'x'.

     o	integrate() now accepts integer results from f(): as documented,
	but only double was accepted.

     o	contrib.url() produced an incorrect URL for the type
         "mac.binary".

     o   pairwise.wilcox.test() did not pass on the 'paired' argument
         (caught by Matthias Kohl)

     o	bmp(), jpeg(), and png() on unix with type="cairo" would segfault
	on closure if the output file could not be opened.

     o	tiff() on unix would not write the output file for the first page
	when multiple pages were plotted.

     o   str(1 + structure(1, class = "test")) no longer recurses 
indefinitely.

     o	pf(x, .., ncp, lower.tail=FALSE, log=TRUE) is much more accurate
	for large x now.

     o	dev2bitmap() failed in 2.8.0 if 'taa' and 'gaa' were both NA.

     o	Under rare circumstances equality tests for character strings
     	could fail to report equality in 2.8.0 in the same way as
     	2.7.2.  (This needed a current encoding of Latin-1 or UTF-8,
     	one string whose encoding was marked as that encoding and one
     	that was marked as "unknown".  In that circumstance the two
     	strings are not actually known to be equal, but earlier
     	versions of R assumed that "unknown" meant the current
     	encoding, and this is done once again.)

     o	R CMD config could echo messages from GNU make if called from
	within a Makefile (as e.g. package Rcpp did), especially from
	within a parallel make run.

     o	Rounding error could affect window(extend=TRUE) when applied
	to monthly series.  (PR#13272)

     o	Offline help on a Unix-alike now works even if options
	"latexcmd" and "dvipscmd" contain spaces
	(e.g. "dvips -Pmy_printer").

	Informative error messages are given if running latex or dvips
	fail.

     o	Using plot.lm() on a "glm" object since 2.7.1 with which=5
	caused the Pearson rather than deviance residuals to be used
	in which=2 or 3 (including in the default case).  (Thanks to
	Effie Greathouse and Greg Snow.)

	plot.lm() did not report on omitting observations with
	leverage one if they also had residual exactly zero.  This was
	seen in example(occupationalStatus).

     o	deparse(nlines=) no longer pads short results with blank
	lines. (PR#13299)

     o	legend(xpd=) now restores 'xpd' correctly.  (PR#12756)

     o	The "formula" method for lines() now works if 'subset' is
	supplied and no 'data' argument (as that for points() did).

     o	Sweave() now takes the defaults for the options 'pdf.version'
	and 'pdf.encoding' of its RweaveLatex driver from pdf.options().

     o	prettyNum(x, drop0trailing=TRUE) treated "1.1e20" as "1.1e2"
	and hence str() did as well, in 2.8.0 only.

     o	dchisq(x, df, ncp) no longer hangs for large x and ncp > 0,
	and is more accurate in some cases (PR#13309).

     o	installed.packages(lib.loc = D, priority="NA") now also works when
	D contains a single package.  (PR#13332)

     o	legend(...., merge=TRUE) now warns and has no effect in the
	case where no line segments are drawn.  (PR#13340)

     o 	transform.data.frame() works better when two or more columns are
	added.

     o	Deparsing argument lists with non-syntactic names (e.g. that for
	transform()) now uses backticks rather than double quotes to
	produce syntactically valid output.

     o	matrix() failed to check for 0-length 'dimnames': it now
	treats them as NULL (as array did).  (PR#13361)

     o	0^NA is now NA, not Inf, consistent with x^NA, x != 1.

     o	anova.mlm() did not work if T had only one row (including
	e.g. the case M = ~1).

     o	axis.POSIXct() mislabelled for some time ranges of a few hours
	(reported by Martin Becker).

     o	mantelhaen.test() with 'exact=FALSE' was not respecting
	'alternative'. It now does one-sided tests similarly to
	prop.test().

     o	anova.mlm() had trouble with some designs where near-zero rows of
	the tranformation matrix were not removed (caught by Nils Skutara).

     o	Rd conversion was handling expressions like
	'\item{foo}{see \eqn{x}}' (with one argument to \eqn
	immediately followed by a right brace) incorrectly, sometimes
	giving a spurious warning about 'missing text'.

     o	R CMD INSTALL used the C locale to install the DESCRIPTION
	file, and so escaped non-ASCII characters in packages with a
	declared encoding of "latin1" or "UTF-8".  (However, the
	installed DESCRIPTION file was rarely used since the dumped
	metadata are available.)

     o	xspline() now respects inline par settings.

	It and grid.xspline() now handle the special case of only two
	control points, and splines with control points that are
	located well outside the device (e.g., a zoomed view of a
	larger curve).	(Both cases were giving the error "reached
	MAXNUMPTS").

     o	In setClass("C", contains="list"); x <- new("C", 1:3), x[2:3] now
         remains of class "C".  So does rep(x, 2) or rep.int(x, 3).

     o	median.default() now also works for "numeric"-like vectors.

     o	The pdf() device can now handle the case where an image uses a
	very large number of colours with different levels of
	semi-transparency (alpha-values).  It used to segfault.
	(Also PR#13264.)

     o	window() failed to apply a fuzz to 'start' or 'end' and so
	sometimes warned incorrectly for time series with 'freq' not a
	power of two (e.g. 12 or 24).

     o	unique.default() now preserves the "tzone" attribute on
	"POSIXct" objects.

     o	If all the packages had dependency lists of equal lengths,
	occasionally install.packages() would compute an incorrect
	sort order.

     o	col(x, as.factor=TRUE) and row(x, as.factor=TRUE) would fail
	if x had no column (row) names.  It was documented
	incorrectly, and now returns a matrix factor.

     o	setRepositories() failed if "pkgType" was set to
	"mac.binary.leopard".

     o	formals<-() changed the body of the function if this was a
     	length-one list.

     o	body<-() failed if the function had no arguments.  It now
	warns if discarding elements from a 'value' of type "expression".

     o	qr.coef() failed in the complex case for non-square systems.
     	(PR#13305)

     o	plot.dendrogram(horizontal=TRUE) did not not plot 'edgetext'
	at the correct locations.  (PR#13313)

     o	The starting point for plot.acf(ci.type="ma") was lag 0 when it
	should have been lag 1.  (PR#13071)

     o   There was an obscure bug with srcrefs, which could put the
         parser into a condition giving "Error: bad value" on any input
