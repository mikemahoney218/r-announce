Subject: Release plans for 2.14.2 and 2.15.0
Message-ID: <85FB2210-5B38-413C-9412-A30B007C19DE@cbs.dk>

It is the intention of the R Core Team to release the finalized version of the 2.14.x series at the end of February, and soon thereafter to start the run-in for 2.15.0. I.e.,

2.14.2 "Gift-Getting Season" on Feb 29 (3rd anniversary of R-1.0.0!)
2.15.0 "Easter Beagle" on Mar 30

(We'll see about getting the nicknames into the actual sources this time.)

Further details to follow.

Subject: R 2.14.2 is released + R anniversary
Message-ID: <D5B3AA59-D3D4-44DD-A20D-016D78445545@cbs.dk>

The build system rolled up R-2.14.2.tar.gz (codename "Gift-Getting Season") at 9:00 this morning. This is intended to be the final round-up release of the 2.14 series; see the list below for details.

(The codename is still not part of the actual sources. That feature will have to wait for 2.15.0, "Easter Beagle").

This release also marks the 3rd anniversary of R-1.0.0.

You can get the source code from

   http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.14.2.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.14.2:

  NEW FEATURES:

    o The internal untar() (as used by default by R CMD INSTALL) now
      knows about some pax headers which bsdtar (e.g., the default tar
      for Mac OS >= 10.6) can incorrectly include in tar files, and
      will skip them with a warning.

    o PCRE has been upgraded to version 8.21: as well as bug fixes and
      greater Perl compatibility, this adds a JIT pattern compiler,
      about which PCRE's news says 'large performance benefits can be
      had in many situations'.  This is supported on most but not all R
      platforms.

    o Function compactPDF() in package tools now takes the default for
      argument gs_quality from environment variable GS_QUALITY: there
      is a new value "none", the ultimate default, which prevents
      GhostScript being used in preference to qpdf just because
      environment variable R_GSCMD is set.  If R_GSCMD is unset or set
      to "", the function will try to find a suitable GhostScript
      executable.

    o The included version of zlib has been updated to 1.2.6.

    o For consistency with the logLik() method, nobs() for "nls" files
      now excludes observations with zero weight.  (Reported by Berwin
      Turlach.)

  UTILITIES:

    o R CMD check now reports by default on licenses not according to
      the description in 'Writing R Extensions'.

    o R CMD check has a new option --as-cran to turn on most of the
      customizations that CRAN uses for its incoming checks.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    o R CMD INSTALL will now no longer install certain file types from
      inst/doc: these are almost certainly mistakes and for some
      packages are wasting a lot of space.  These are Makefile, files
      generated by running LaTeX, and unless the package uses a
      vignettes directory, PostScript and image bitmap files.

      Note that only PDF vignettes have ever been supported: some of
      these files come from DVI/PS output from the Sweave defaults
      prior to R 2.13.0.

  BUG FIXES:

    o R configured with --disable-openmp would mistakenly set
      HAVE_OPENMP (internal) and SUPPORT_OPENMP (in Rconfig.h) even
      though no OpenMP flags were populated.

    o The getS3method() implementation had an old computation to find
      an S4 default method.

    o readLines() could overflow a buffer if the last line of the file
      was not terminated.  (PR#14766)

    o R CMD check could miss undocumented S4 objects in packages which
      used S4 classes but did not Depends: methods in their DESCRIPTION
      file.

    o The HTML Help Search page had malformed links.  (PR#14769)

    o A couple of instances of lack of protection of SEXPs have been
      squashed. (PR#14772, PR#14773)

    o image(x, useRaster=TRUE) misbehaved on single-column x.
      (PR#14774)

    o Negative values for options("max.print") or the max argument to
      print.default() caused crashes.  Now the former are ignored and
      the latter trigger an error.  (PR#14779)

    o The text of a function body containing more than 4096 bytes was
      not properly saved by the parser when entered at the console.

    o Forgetting the #endif tag in an Rd file could cause the parser to
      go into a loop.  (Reported by Hans-Jorg Bibiko.)

    o str(*, ....., strict.width="cut") now also obeys list.len = n.
      (Reported by S"oren Vogel.)

    o Printing of arrays did not have enough protection (C level),
      e.g., in the context of capture.output().  (Reported by Herv'e
      Pag`es and Martin Morgan.)

    o pdf(file = NULL) would produce a spurious file named NA.
      (PR#14808)

    o list2env() did not check the type of its envir argument.
      (PR#14807)

    o svg() could segfault if called with a non-existent file path.
      (PR#14790)

    o make install can install to a path containing + characters.
      (PR#14798)

    o The edit() function did not respect the options("keep.source")
      setting. (Reported by Cleridy Lennert.)

    o predict.lm(*, type="terms", terms=*, se.fit=TRUE) did not work.
      (PR#14817)

    o There is a partial workaround for errors in the TRE
      regular-expressions engine with named classes and repeat counts
      of at least 2 in a MBCS locale (PR#14408): these are avoided when
      TRE is in 8-bit mode (e.g. for useBytes = TRUE and when all the
      data are ASCII).

    o The C function R_ReplDLLdo1() did not call top-level handlers.

    o The Quartz device was unable to detect window sessions on Mac OS
      X 10.7 (Lion) and higher and thus it was not used as the default
      device on the console.  Since Lion any application can use window
      sessions, so Quartz will now be the default device if the user's
      window session is active and R is not run via ssh which is at
      least close to the behavior in prior OS X versions.

    o mclapply() would fail in code assembling the translated error
      message if some (but not all) cores encountered an error.

    o format.POSIXlt(x) raised an arithmetic exception when x was an
      invalid object of class "POSIXlt" and parts were empty.

    o installed.packages() has some more protection against package
      installs going on in parallel.

    o .Primitive() could be mis-used to call .Internal() entry points.

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.15.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    o The behaviour of unlink(recursive = TRUE) for a symbolic link to
      a directory has changed: it now removes the link rather than the
      directory contents (just as rm -r does).

      On Windows it no longer follows reparse points (including
      junctions and symbolic links).

  NEW FEATURES:

    o Environment variable RD2DVI_INPUTENC has been renamed to
      RD2PDF_INPUTENC.

    o .Deprecated() becomes a bit more flexible, getting an old
      argument.

    o Even data-only packages without R code need a namespace and so
      may need to be installed under R 2.14.0 or later.

    o assignInNamespace() has further restrictions on use apart from at
      top-level, as its help page has warned.  Expect it to be disabled
      from programmatic use in the future.

    o system() and system2() when capturing output report a non-zero
      status in the new "status" attribute.

    o kronecker() now has an S4 generic in package methods on which
      packages can set methods.  It will be invoked by X %x% Y if
      either X or Y is an S4 object.

    o pdf() accepts forms like file = "|lpr" in the same way as
      postscript().

    o pdf() accepts file = NULL.  This means that the device does NOT
      create a PDF file (but it can still be queried, e.g., for font
      metric info).

    o format() (and hence print()) on "bibentry" objects now uses
      options("width") to set the output width.

    o legend() gains a text.font argument. (Suggested by Tim Paine,
      PR#14719.)

    o nchar() and nzchar() no longer accept factors (as integer
      vectors).  (Wish of PR#6899.)

    o summary() behaves slightly differently (or more precisely, its
      print() method does).  For numeric inputs, the number of NAs is
      printed as an integer and not a real.  For dates and datetimes,
      the number of NAs is included in the printed output (the latter
      being the wish of PR#14720).

      The "data.frame" method is more consistent with the default
      method: in particular it now applies zapsmall() to
      numeric/complex summaries.

    o The number of items retained with options(warn = 0) can be set by
      options(nwarnings=).

    o There is a new function assignInMyNamespace() which uses the
      namespace of the function it is called from.

    o attach() allows the default name for an attached file to be
      overridden.

    o bxp(), the work horse of boxplot(), now uses a more sensible
      default xlim in the case where at is specified differently from
      1:n, see the discussion on R-devel, <URL:
      https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2011-November/062586.html>.

    o New function paste0(), an efficient version of paste(*, sep=""),
      to be used in many places for more concise (and slightly more
      efficient) code.

    o Function setClass() in package methods now returns, invisibly, a
      generator function for the new class, slightly preferred to
      calling new(), as explained on the setClass help page.

    o The "dendrogram" method of str() now takes its default for
      last.str from option str.dendrogram.last.

    o New simple fitted() method for "kmeans" objects.

    o The traceback() function can now be called with an integer
      argument, to display a current stack trace. (Wish of PR#14770.)

    o setGeneric() calls can be simplified when creating a new generic
      function by supplying the default method as the def argument.
      See ?setGeneric.

    o serialize() has a new option xdr = FALSE which will use the
      native byte-order for binary serializations.  In scenarios where
      only little-endian machines are involved (these days, close to
      universal) and (un)serialization takes an appreciable amount of
      time this may speed up noticeably transferring data between
      systems.

    o The internal (un)serialization code is faster for long vectors,
      particularly with XDR on some platforms.  (Based on a suggested
      patch by Michael Spiegel.)

    o For consistency, circles with zero radius are omitted by points()
      and grid.circle().  Previously this was device-dependent, but
      they were usually invisible.

    o NROW(x) and NCOL(x) now work whenever dim(x) looks appropriate,
      e.g., also for more generalized matrices.

    o PCRE has been updated to version 8.30.

    o The internal R_Srcref variable is now updated before the browser
      stops on entering a function.  (Suggestion of PR#14818.)

    o There are 'bare-bones' functions .colSums(), .rowSums(),
      .colMeans() and .rowMeans() for use in programming where ultimate
      speed is required.

    o The formerly internal function .package_dependencies() from
      package tools for calculating (recursive) (reverse) dependencies
      on package databases has been renamed to package_dependencies()
      and is now exported.

    o There is a new function optimHess() to compute the (approximate)
      Hessian for an optim() solution if hessian = TRUE was forgotten.

    o .filled.contour() is a 'bare-bones' function to add a
      filled-contour rectangular plot to an already prepared plot
      region.

    o The stepping in debugging and single-step browsing modes has
      changed slightly: now left braces at the start of the body are
      stepped over for if statements as well as for for and while
      statements.  (Wish of PR#14814.)

    o library() no longer warns about a conflict with a function from
      package:base if the function has the same code as the base one
      but with a different environment.  (An example is Matrix::det().)

    o When deparsing very large language objects, as.character() now
      inserts newlines after each line of approximately 500 bytes,
      rather than truncating to the first line.

    o New function rWishart() generates Wishart-distributed random
      matrices.

    o Packages may now specify actions to be taken when the package is
      loaded (setLoadActions()).

    o options(max.print = Inf) and similar now give an error (instead
      of warnings later).

    o The "difftime" replacement method of units tries harder to
      preserve other attributes of the argument.  (Wish of PR#14839.)

    o poly(raw = TRUE) no longer requires more unique points than the
      degree.  (Requested by John Fox.)

  PACKAGE parallel:

    o There is a new function mcmapply(), a parallel version of
      mapply(), and a wrapper mcMap(), a parallel version of Map().

    o A default cluster can be registered by the new function
      setDefaultCluster(): this will be used by default in functions
      such as parLapply().

    o clusterMap() has a new argument .scheduling to allow the use of
      load-balancing.

    o There are new load-balancing functions parLapplyLB() and
      parSapplyLB().

    o makePSOCKCluster() has a new option useXDR = FALSE which can be
      used to avoid byte-shuffling for serialization when all the nodes
      are known to be little-endian (or all big-endian).

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    o Non-ASCII vignettes without a declared encoding are no longer
      accepted.

    o C/C++ code in packages is now compiled with -NDEBUG to mitigate
      against the C/C++ function assert being called in production use.
      Developers can turn this off during package development with
      PKG_CPPFLAGS = -UNDEBUG.

    o R CMD INSTALL has a new option --dsym which on Mac OS X (Darwin)
      dumps the symbols alongside the .so file: this is helpful when
      debugging with valgrind (and especially when installing packages
      into R.framework).  [This can also be enabled by setting the
      undocumented environment variable PKG_MAKE_DSYM, since R 2.12.0.]

    o R CMD INSTALL will test loading under all installed
      sub-architectures even for packages without compiled code, unless
      the flag --no-multiarch is used.  (Pure R packages can do things
      which are architecture-dependent: in the case which prompted
      this, looking for an icon in a Windows R executable.)

    o There is a new option install.packages(type = "both") which tries
      source packages if binary packages are not available, on those
      platforms where the latter is the default.

    o The meaning of install.packages(dependencies = TRUE) has changed:
      it now means to install the essential dependencies of the named
      packages plus the Suggests, but only the essential dependencies
      of dependencies.  To get the previous behaviour, specify
      dependencies as a character vector.

    o R CMD INSTALL --merge-multiarch is now supported on OS X and
      other Unix-alikes using multiple sub-architectures.

    o R CMD INSTALL --libs-only now by default does a test load on
      Unix-alikes as well as on Windows: suppress with --no-test-load.

  UTILITIES:

    o R CMD check now gives a warning rather than a note if it finds
      inefficiently compressed datasets.  With bzip2 and xz compression
      having been available since R 2.10.0, it only exceptionally makes
      sense to not use them.

      The environment variable _R_CHECK_COMPACT_DATA2_ is no longer
      consulted: the check is always done if _R_CHECK_COMPACT_DATA_ has
      a true value (its default).

    o Where multiple sub-architectures are to be tested, R CMD check
      now runs the examples and tests for all the sub-architectures
      even if one fails.

    o R CMD check can optionally report timings on various parts of the
      check: this is controlled by environment variable
      _R_CHECK_TIMINGS_ documented in 'Writing R Extensions'.  Timings
      (in the style of R CMD BATCH) are given at the foot of the output
      files from running each test and the R code in each vignette.

    o There are new options for more rigorous testing by R CMD check
      selected by environment variables - see the 'Writing R
      Extensions' manual.

    o R CMD check now warns (rather than notes) on undeclared use of
      other packages in examples and tests: increasingly people are
      using the metadata in the DESCRIPTION file to compute information
      about packages, for example reverse dependencies.

    o The defaults for some of the options in R CMD check (described in
      the 'R Internals' manual) have changed: checks for unsafe and
      .Internal() calls and for partial matching of arguments in R
      function calls are now done by default.

    o R CMD check has more comprehensive facilities for checking
      compiled code and so gives fewer reports on entry points linked
      into .so/.dll files from libraries (including C++ and Fortran
      runtimes).

      Checking compiled code is now done on FreeBSD (as well as the
      existing supported platforms of Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and
      Windows).

    o R CMD build has more options for --compact-vignettes: see R CMD
      build --help.

    o R CMD build has a new option --md5 to add an MD5 file (as done by
      CRAN): this is used by R CMD INSTALL to check the integrity of
      the distribution.

      If this option is not specified, any existing (and probably
      stale) MD5 file is removed.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    o R CMD Rd2dvi is now defunct: use R CMD Rd2pdf.

    o Options such --max-nsize, --max-vsize and the function
      mem.limits() are now defunct.  (Options --min-nsize and
      --min-vsize remain available.)

    o Use of library.dynam() without specifying all the first three
      arguments is now disallowed.

      Use of an argument chname in library.dynam() including the
      extension .so or .dll (which was never allowed according to the
      help page) is defunct.  This also applies to
      library.dynam.unload() and to useDynLib directives in NAMESPACE
      files.

    o The internal functions .readRDS() and .saveRDS() are now defunct.

    o The off-line help() types "postscript" and "ps" are defunct.

    o Sys.putenv(), replaced and deprecated in R 2.5.0, is finally
      removed.

    o Some functions/objects which have been defunct for five or more
      years have been removed completely.  These include .Alias(),
      La.chol(), La.chol2inv(), La.eigen(), Machine(), Platform(),
      Version, codes(), delay(), format.char(), getenv(), httpclient(),
      loadURL(), machine(), parse.dcf(), printNoClass(), provide(),
      read.table.url(), restart(), scan.url(), symbol.C(), symbol.For()
      and unix().

    o The ENCODING argument to .C() is deprecated.  It was intended to
      smooth the transition to multi-byte character strings, but can be
      replaced by the use of iconv() in the rare cases where it is
      still needed.

  INSTALLATION:

    o Building with a positive value of --with-valgrind-instrumentation
      now also instruments logical, complex and raw vectors.

    o There is experimental support for _link-time optimization_ with
      gcc 4.5.0 or later on platforms which support it.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    o Passing R objects other than atomic vectors, functions, lists and
      environments to .C() is now deprecated and will give a warning.
      Most cases (especially NULL) are actually coding errors.  NULL
      will be disallowed in future.

      .C() now passes a pairlist as a SEXP to the compiled code.  This
      is as was documented, but pairlists were in reality handled
      differently as a legacy from the early days of R.

    o call_R and call_S are deprecated.  They still exist in the
      headers and as entry points, but are no longer documented and
      should not be used for new code.

  BUG FIXES:

    o str(x, width) now obeys its width argument also for function
      headers and other objects x where deparse() is applied.

    o The convention for x %/% 0L for integer-mode x has been changed
      from 0L to NA_integer_.  (PR#14754)

    o The exportMethods directive in a NAMESPACE file now exports S4
      generics as necessary, as the extensions manual said it does.
      The manual has also been updated to be a little more informative
      on this point.

      It is now required that there is an S4 generic (imported or
      created in the package) when methods are to be exported.

    o Reference methods cannot safely use non-exported entries in the
      namespace.  We now do not do so, and warn in the documentation.

    o The namespace import code was warning when identical S4 generic
      functions were imported more than once, but should not (reported
      by Brian Ripley, then Martin Morgan).

    o merge() is no longer allowed (in some ways) to create a data
      frame with duplicate column names (which confused PR#14786).

    o Fixes for rendering raster images on X11 and Windows devices when
      the x-axis or y-axis scale is reversed.

    o getAnywhere() found S3 methods as seen from the utils namespace
      and not from the environment from which it was called.

    o selectMethod(f, sig) would not return inherited group methods
      when caching was off (as it is by default).

    o dev.copy2pdf(out.type = "cairo") gave an error.  (PR#14827)

    o Virtual classes (e.g., class unions) had a NULL prototype even if
      that was not a legal subclass.  See ?setClassUnion.

    o The C prototypes for zdotc and zdotu in R_ext/BLAS.h have been
      changed to the more modern style rather than that used by f2c.
      (Patch by Berwin Turlach.)

    o isGeneric() produced an error for primitives that can not have
      methods.

    o .C() or .Fortran() had a lack-of-protection error if the
      registration information resulted in an argument being coerced to
      another type.

    o boxplot(x=x, at=at) with non finite elements in x and non integer
      at could not generate a warning but failed.

    o heatmap(x, symm=TRUE, RowSideColors=*) no longer draws the colors
      in reversed order.

    o predict(<ar>) was incorrect in the multivariate case, for p >= 2.

    o print(x, max=m) is now consistent when x is a "Date"; also the
      "reached ... max.print .." messages are now consistently using
      single brackets.

    o Closed the <li> tag in pages generated by Rd2HTML(). (PR#14841.)

    o Axis tick marks could go out of range when a log scale was used.
      (PR#14833.)

    o Signature objects in methods were not allocated as S4 objects
      (caused a problem with trace() reported by Martin Morgan).

Just a note, mainly to people who maintain larger R installations, that we intend to have a patch release version on June 22. The nickname will be "Roasted Marshmallows".

This is somewhat later than previous .1 releases, but we are also now aiming for an annual rather than biannual release scheme.  There have been very few issues with 2.15.0, but some people may be waiting superstitiously for a .1 release (or expecting one come along any day now) and need to be informed about the plans.

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.15.1:

  NEW FEATURES:

    o source() now uses withVisible() rather than
      .Internal(eval.with.vis).  This sometimes alters tracebacks
      slightly.

    o install.packages("pkg_version.tgz") on Mac OS X now has sanity
      checks that this is actually a binary package (as people have
      tried it with incorrectly named source packages).

    o splineDesign() and spline.des() in package splines have a new
      option sparse which can be used for efficient construction of a
      sparse B-spline design matrix (_via_ Matrix).

    o norm() now allows type = "2" (the 'spectral' or 2-norm) as well,
      mainly for didactical completeness.

    o pmin() and pmax()) now also work when one of the inputs is of
      length zero and others are not, returning a zero-length vector,
      analogously to, say, +.

    o colorRamp() (and hence colorRampPalette()) now also works for the
      boundary case of just one color when the ramp is flat.

    o qqline() has new optional arguments distribution, probs and
      qtype, following the example of lattice's panel.qqmathline().

    o .C() gains some protection against the misuse of character vector
      arguments.  (An all too common error is to pass character(N),
      which initializes the elements to "", and then attempt to edit
      the strings in-place, sometimes forgetting to terminate them.)

    o Calls to the new function globalVariables() in package utils
      declare that functions and other objects in a package should be
      treated as globally defined, so that CMD check will not note
      them.

    o print(packageDescription(*)) trims the Collate field by default.

    o The included copy of zlib has been updated to version 1.2.7.

    o A new option "show.error.locations" has been added.  When set to
      TRUE, error messages will contain the location of the most recent
      call containing source reference information. (Other values are
      supported as well; see ?options.)

    o The NA warning messages from e.g. pchisq() now report the call to
      the closure and not that of the .Internal.

    o Added Polish translations by <c5><81>ukasz Daniel.

  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

    o In package parallel, makeForkCluster() and the multicore-based
      functions use native byte-order for serialization (deferred from
      2.15.0).

    o lm.fit(), lm.wfit(), glm.fit() and lsfit() do less copying of
      objects, mainly by using .Call() rather than .Fortran().

    o .C() and .Fortran() do less copying: arguments which are raw,
      logical, integer, real or complex vectors and are unnamed are not
      copied before the call, and (named or not) are not copied after
      the call.  Lists are no longer copied (they are supposed to be
      used read-only in the C code).

    o tabulate() makes use of .C(DUP = FALSE) and hence does not copy
      bin.  (Suggested by Tim Hesterberg.)  It also avoids making a
      copy of a factor argument bin.

    o Other functions (often or always) doing less copying include
      cut(), dist(), the complex case of eigen(), hclust(), image(),
      kmeans(), loess(), stl() and svd(LINPACK = TRUE).

    o There is less copying when using primitive replacement functions
      such as names(), attr() and attributes().

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    o The converters for use with .C() (see ?getCConverterDescriptions)
      are deprecated: use the .Call() interface instead.  There are no
      known examples (they were never fully documented).

  UTILITIES:

    o For R CMD check, a few people have reported problems with
      junctions on Windows (although they were tested on Windows 7, XP
      and Server 2008 machines and it is unknown under what
      circumstances the problems occur).  Setting the environment
      variable R_WIN_NO_JUNCTIONS to a non-empty value (e.g. in
      ~/.R/check.Renviron) will force copies to be used instead.

  INSTALLATION:

    o R CMD INSTALL with _R_CHECK_INSTALL_DEPENDS_ set to a true value
      (as done by R CMD check --as-cran) now restricts the packages
      available when lazy-loading as well as when test-loading (since
      packages such as ETLUtils and agsemisc had top-level calls to
      library() for undeclared packages).

      This check is now also available on Windows.

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    o C entry points mkChar and mkCharCE now check that the length of
      the string they are passed does not exceed 2^31-1 bytes: they
      used to overflow with unpredictable consequences.

    o C entry points R_GetCurrentSrcref and R_GetSrcFilename have been
      added to the API to allow debuggers access to the source
      references on the stack.

  WINDOWS-SPECIFIC CHANGES:

    o Windows-specific changes will now be announced in this file
      (NEWS).  Changes up and including R 2.15.0 remain in the CHANGES
      file.

    o There are two new environment variables which control the
      defaults for command-line options.

      If R_WIN_INTERNET2 is set to a non-empty value, it is as if
      --internet2 was used.

      If R_MAX_MEM_SIZE is set, it gives the default memory limit if
      --max-mem-size is not specified: invalid values being ignored.

  BUG FIXES:

    o lsfit() lost the names from the residuals.

    o More cases in which merge() could create a data frame with
      duplicate column names now give warnings.  Cases where names
      specified in by match multiple columns are errors.

    o Nonsense uses such as seq(1:50, by = 5) (from package plotrix)
      and seq.int(1:50, by = 5) are now errors.

    o The residuals in the 5-number summary printed by summary() on an
      "lm" object are now explicitly labelled as weighted residuals
      when non-constant weights are present.  (Wish of PR#14840.)

    o tracemem() reported that all objects were copied by .C() or
      .Fortran() whereas only some object types were ever copied.

      It also reported and marked as copies _some_ transformations such
      as rexp(n, x): it no longer does so.

    o The plot() method for class "stepfun" only used the optional xval
      argument to compute xlim and not the points at which to plot (as
      documented).  (PR#14864)

    o Names containing characters which need to be escaped were not
      deparsed properly.  (PR#14846)

    o Trying to update (recommended) packages in R_HOME/library without
      write access is now dealt with more gracefully.  Further, such
      package updates may be skipped (with a warning), when a newer
      installed version is already going to be used from .libPaths().
      (PR#14866)

    o hclust() is now fast again (as up to end of 2003), with a
      different fix for the "median"/"centroid" problem.  (PR#4195).

    o get_all_vars() failed when the data came entirely from vectors in
      the global environment. (PR#14847)

    o R CMD check with _R_CHECK_NO_RECOMMENDED_ set to a true value (as
      done by the --as-cran option) could issue false errors if there
      was an indirect dependency on a recommended package.

    o formatC() uses the C entry point str_signif which could write
      beyond the length allocated for the output string.

    o Missing default argument added to implicit S4 generic for
      backsolve(). (PR#14883)

    o Some bugs have been fixed in handling load actions that could
      fail to export assigned items or generate spurious warnings in
      CMD check on loading.

    o For tiff(type = "windows"), the numbering of per-page files
      except the last was off by one.

    o On Windows, loading package stats (which is done for a default
      session) would switch line endings on stdout and stderr from CRLF
      to LF.  This affected Rterm and R CMD BATCH.

    o On Windows, the compatibility function x11() had not kept up with
      changes to windows(), and issued warnings about bad parameters.
      (PR#14880)

    o On Windows, the Sys.glob() function did not handle UNC paths as
      it was designed to try to do. (PR#14884)

    o In package parallel, clusterApply() and similar failed to handle
      a (pretty pointless) length-1 argument. (PR#14898)

    o Quartz Cocoa display reacted asynchronously to dev.flush() which
      means that the redraw could be performed after the plot has been
      already modified by subsequent code. The redraw is now done
      synchronously in dev.flush() to allow animations without sleep
      cycles.

    o Source locations reported in traceback() were incorrect when
      byte-compiled code was on the stack.

    o plogis(x, lower = FALSE, log.p = TRUE) no longer underflows early
      for large x (e.g. 800).

    o ?Arithmetic's "1 ^ y and y ^ 0 are 1, _always_" now also applies
      for integer vectors y.

    o X11-based pixmap devices like png(type = "Xlib") were trying to
      set the cursor style, which triggered some warnings and hangs.

    o Code executed by the built-in HTTP server no longer allows other
      HTTP clients to re-enter R until the current worker evaluation
      finishes, to prevent cascades.

    o The plot() and Axis() methods for class "table" now respect
      graphical parameters such as cex.axis.  (Reported by Martin
      Becker.)

    o Under some circumstances package.skeleton() would give out
      progress reports that could not be translated and so were
      displayed by question marks.  Now they are always in English.
      (This was seen for CJK locales on Windows, but may have occurred
      elsewhere.)

    o The evaluator now keeps track of source references outside of
      functions, e.g. when source() executes a script.

    o The replacement method for window() now works correctly for
      multiple time series of class "mts".  (PR#14925)

    o is.unsorted() gave incorrect results on non-atomic objects such
      as data frames.  (Reported by Matthew Dowle.)

    o The value returned by tools::psnice() for invalid pid values was
      not always NA as documented.

    o Closing an X11() window while locator() was active could abort
      the R process.

    o getMethod(f, sig) produced an incorrect error message in some
      cases when f was not a string).

    o Using a string as a "call" in an error condition with
      options(showErrorCalls=TRUE) could cause a segfault.  (PR#14931)

    o The string "infinity" allowed by C99 was not accepted as a
      numerical string value by e.g. scan() and as.character().
      (PR#14933)

    o In legend(), setting some entries of lwd to NA was inconsistent
      (depending on the graphics device) in whether it would suppress
      those lines; now it consistently does so.  (PR#14926)

    o by() failed for a zero-row data frame.  (Reported by Weiqiang
      Qian)

    o Yates correction in chisq.test() could be bigger than the terms
      it corrected, previously leading to an infinite test statistic in
      some corner cases which are now reported as NaN.

    o xgettext() and related functions sometimes returned items that
      were not strings for translation. (PR#14935)

    o plot(<lm>, which=5) now correctly labels the factor level
      combinations for the special case where all h[i,i] are the same.
      (PR#14837)

CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.15.2:

  NEW FEATURES:

    o The X11() window gains an icon: the latter may be especially
      useful on Ubuntu's 'Unity' interface.

      The WM_CLASS should be set in circumstances where the Window
      Manager failed to make use of X11 resource settings.

      (Contributed by Philip Johnson.)

    o The "Date" and "POSIXt" methods for cut() will accept an unsorted
      breaks argument (as the default method does, although this was
      undocumented).  (Wish of PR#14961.)

    o Reference class methods (in the methods package) that use other
      methods in an indirect way (e.g., by sapply()) must tell the code
      analysis to include that method.  They can now do so by invoking
      $usingMethods().

    o More Polish translations are available: for the RGui menus and
      for several recommended packages.

    o Multistratum MANOVA works. In fact, it seems to have done so for
      years in spite of the help page claiming it did not.

    o qqline() has new optional arguments distribution, probs and
      qtype, following the example of lattice's panel.qqmathline().

    o The handling of single quotes in the en at quot pseudo-language has
      been slightly improved.  Double quotes are no longer converted.

    o New functions checkPoFiles() and checkPoFile() have been added to
      the tools package to check for consistency of format strings in
      translation files.

    o model.matrix(~1, ...) now also contains the same rownames that
      less trivial formulae produce.  (Wish of PR#14992, changes the
      output of several packages.)

    o Misuse of rep() on undocumented types of objects (e.g. calls) is
      now reported as an error.

    o The included LAPACK has been updated to 3.4.1, with some patches
      from the current SVN sources.  (_Inter alia_, this resolves
      PR#14692.)

    o file.copy(recursive = TRUE) has some additional checks on user
      error leading to attempted infinite recursion (and on some
      platforms to crashing R).

    o PCRE has been updated to version 8.31, a bug-fix release.

    o The included version of liblzma has been updated to version
      5.0.4, a minor bug-fix release.

    o New function .bincode(), a 'bare-bones' version of
      cut.default(labels = FALSE) for use in packages with image()
      methods.

    o The HTML manuals now use directional single quotes.

    o maintainer() now converts embedded new lines to spaces.  It no
      longer gives a non-obvious error for non-installed packages.

    o The X11() device has some protection against being used with
      forked processes _via_ package parallel.

    o Setting the environment variable R_OSX_VALGRIND (to any value)
      allows R to be run under valgrind on Mac OS 10.6 and 10.7
      (valgrind currently has very limited support for 10.8), provided
      system() is not used (directly or indirectly).  This should not
      be needed for valgrind >= 3.8.1.

    o The model.frame() method for "lm" uses xlevels: this is safer if
      data was supplied or model = FALSE was used and the levels of
      factors used in the fit had been re-ordered since fitting.

      Similarly, model.frame(fm, data=<data>) copies across the
      variables used for safe prediction from the fit.

    o Functions such as parLapply() in package parallel can make use of
      a default cluster if one is set.  (Reported by Martin Morgan.)

    o chol(pivot = TRUE, LINPACK = FALSE) is now available using LAPACK
      3.2 subroutine DPSTRF.

    o The functions .C(), .Call(), .External() and .Fortran() now check
      that they are called with an unnamed first argument: the formal
      arguments were changed from name= to .NAME= in R 2.13.0, but some
      packages were still using the old name.  This is currently a
      warning, but will be an error in future.

    o step() no longer tries to improve a model with AIC of -Inf (a
      perfect fit).

    o spline() and splinefun() gain a new method "hyman", an
      implementation of Hyman's method of constructing monotonic
      interpolation splines.  (Based on contributions of Simon Wood and
      Rob Hyndman.)

    o On Windows, the C stack size has been increased to 64MB (it has
      been 10MB since the days of 32MB RAM systems).

  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

    o array() is now implemented in C code (for speed) when data is
      atomic or an unclassed list (so it is known that as.vector(data)
      will have no class to be used by rep()).

    o rep() is faster and uses less memory, substantially so in some
      common cases (e.g. if times is of length one or length.out is
      given, and each = 1).

    o findInterval(), tabulate(), cut(), hist() and image.default() all
      use .Call() and are more efficient.

    o duplicated(), unique() and similar now support vectors of lengths
      above 2^29 on 64-bit platforms.

    o Omitting PACKAGE in .C() etc calls was supposed to make use of
      the DLL from the namespace within which the enclosing function
      was defined.  It was less successful in doing so than it might
      be, and gave no indication it had failed.

      A new search strategy is very successful and gives a warning when
      it fails.  In most cases this is because the entry point is not
      actually provided by that package (and so PACKAGE should be used
      to indicate which package is intended) but in some the namespace
      does not have a DLL specified by a useDynLib() directive so
      PACKAGE is required.

  UTILITIES:

    o R CMD check now checks if a package can be loaded by
      library(pkgname, lib.loc = "somewhere") without being on the
      library search path (unless it is already installed in .Library,
      when it always will be).

    o R CMD check --as-cran notes 'hidden' files and directories (with
      names starting with a dot) that are not needed for the operation
      of R CMD INSTALL or R CMD build: such files should be excluded
      from the published tarball.

    o R CMD check (if checking subdirectories) checks that the R code
      in any demos is ASCII and can be parsed, and warns if not.

    o When R CMD Rd2pdf is used with inputenx.sty, it allows further
      characters (mainly for Eastern European languages) by including
      ix-utf8enc.dfu (if available).  (Wish of PR#14989.)

    o R CMD build now omits several types of hidden files/directories,
      including inst/doc/.Rinstignore, vignettes/.Rinstignore,
      (.Rinstignore should be at top level), .deps under src,
      .Renviron, .Rprofile, .Rproj.user, .backups, .cvsignore,
      .cproject, .directory, .dropbox, .exrc, .gdb.history,
      .gitattributes, .gitignore, .gitmodules, .hgignore, .hgtags,
      .htaccess, .latex2html-init, .project, .seed, .settings,
      .tm_properties and various leftovers.

    o R CMD check now checks for .C(), .Call(), .External() and
      .Fortran() calls in other packages, and gives a warning on those
      found from R itself (which are not part of the API and change
      without notice: many will changed for R 2.16.0).

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    o The limit for R_alloc on 64-bit platforms has been raised to just
      under 32GB (from just under 16GB).

    o The misuse of .C("name", ..., PACKAGE = foo) where foo is an
      arbitrary R object is now an error.

      The misuse .C("name",..., PACKAGE = "") is now warned about in R
      CMD check, and will be an error in future.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    o Use of array() with a 0-length dim argument is deprecated with a
      warning (and was contrary to the documentation).

    o Use of tapply() with a 0-length INDEX list is deprecated with a
      warning.

    o Translation packages are deprecated.

    o Calling rep() or rep.int() on a pairlist is deprecated and will
      give a warning.  In any case, rep() converted a pairlist to a
      list so you may as well do that explicitly.

    o Entry point rcont2 is no longer part of the API, and will move to
      package stats in R 2.16.0.

    o The 'internal' graphics device invoked by
      .Call("R_GD_nullDevice", package = "grDevices") is about to be
      removed: use pdf(file = NULL) instead.

    o eigen(EISPACK = TRUE), chol(pivot = FALSE, LINPACK = TRUE),
      chol2inv(LINPACK = TRUE), solve(LINPACK = TRUE) and svd(LINPACK =
      TRUE) are deprecated and give a warning.

      They were provided for compatibility with R 1.7.0 (Mar 2003)!

    o The 'internal function' kappa.tri() has been renamed to
      .kappa_tri() so it is not inadvertently called as a method for
      class "tri".

    o Functions sessionData() and browseAll() in package methods are on
      a help page describing them as 'deprecated' and are now formally
      deprecated.

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    o For a Windows or Mac OS X binary package install,
      install.packages() will check if a source package is available on
      the same repositories, and report if it is a later version or
      there is a source package but no binary package available.

      This check can be suppressed: see the help page.

    o install.packages(type = "both") has been enhanced.  In
      interactive use it will ask whether to choose the source version
      of a package if the binary version is older and contains compiled
      code, and also asks if source packages with no binary version
      should be installed).

  INSTALLATION:

    o There is a new configure option --with-libtiff (mainly in case
      the system installation needs to be avoided).

    o LAPACK 3.4.1 does use some Fortran 90 features, so g77 no longer
      suffices.

    o If an external LAPACK is used, it must be version 3.2 or later.

  BUG FIXES:

    o On Windows, starting Rterm via R.exe caused Ctrl-C to misbehave.
      (PR#14948)

    o The tools::latexToUtf8() function missed conversions that were
      contained within braces.

    o Long timezone specifications (such as a file name preceded by :)
      could crash as.POSIXlt.  (PR#14945)

    o R CMD build --resave-data could fail if there was no data
      directory but there was an R/sysdata.rda file.  (PR#14947)

    o is.na() misbehaved on a 0-column data frame.  (PR#14959)

    o anova.lmlist() failed if test was supplied.  (PR#14960)

      It was unable to compute Cp tests for object of class "lm" (it
      assumed class "glm").

    o The formula method for sunflowerplot() now allows xlab and ylab
      to be set.  (Reported by Gerrit Eichner.)

    o The "POSIXt" and "Date" methods for hist() could fail on Windows
      where adjustments to the right-hand boundary crossed a DST
      transition time.

    o On Windows, the code in as.POSIXct() to handle incorrectly
      specified isdst fields might have resulted in NA being returned.

    o aov() and manova() gave spurious warning about singular error
      model in the multiresponse case.

    o In ns() and bs(), specifying knots = NULL is now equivalent to
      omitting it, also when df is specified.  (PR#14970)

    o sprintf() did not accept numbered arguments ending in zero.
      (PR#14975)

    o rWishart() could overflow the C stack and maybe crash the R
      process for dimensions of several hundreds or more.  (Reported by
      Michael Braun on R-sig-mac.)

    o Base package vignettes (e.g. vignette("Sweave")) were not fully
      installed in builds of R from the tarball.

    o lchoose() and choose() could overflow the C stack and crash R.

    o When given a 0-byte file and asked to keep source references,
      parse() read input from stdin() instead.

    o pdf(compress = TRUE) did not delete temporary files it created
      until the end of the R session.  (PR#14991)

    o logLik() did not detect the error of applying it to a
      multiple-response linear model.  (PR#15000)

    o file.copy(recursive = TRUE) did not always report FALSE for a
      failure two or more directories deep.

    o qgeom() could return -1 for extremely small q. (PR#14967.)

    o smooth.spline() used DUP = FALSE which allowed its compiled C
      code to change the function: this was masked by the default
      byte-compilation. (PR#14965.)

    o In Windows, the GUI preferences for foreground color were not
      always respected.  (Reported by Benjamin Wells.)

    o On OS X, the Quartz versions of the bitmap devices did not
      respect antialias = "none".  (PR#15006.)

    o unique() and similar would infinite-loop if called on a vector of
      length > 2^29 (but reported that the vector was too long for 2^30
      or more).

    o parallel::stopCluster() now works with MPI clusters without snow
      being on the search path.

    o terms.formula() could exhaust the stack, and the stack check did
      not always catch this before the segfault.  (PR#15013)

    o sort.list(method = "radix") could give incorrect results on
      certain compilers (seen with clang on Mac OS 10.7 and Xcode
      4.4.1).

    o backsolve(T, b) gave incorrect results when nrows(b) > ncols(T)
      and b had more than one column.

      It could segfault or give nonsense if k was specified as more
      than ncols(T).

    o smooth.spline() did not check that a specified numeric spar was
      of length 1, and gave corrupt results if it was of length 0.

    o Protection added to do_system. (PR#15025)

    o Printing of vectors with names > 1000 characters now works
      correctly rather than truncating. (PR#15028)

    o qr() for a complex matrix did not pivot the column names.

    o --with-blas='-framework vecLib' now also works on OS X 10.8.

    o R CMD check no longer fails with an error if a DESCRIPTION file
      incorrectly contains a blank line.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)

    o install.packages(type = "both") could call chooseCRANmirror()
      twice.

    o lm.wfit() could segfault in R 2.15.1 if all the weights were
      zero. (PR#15044)

    o A malformed package name could cause R CMD INSTALL to write
      outside the target library.

    o Some of the quality control functions (e.g. tools::checkFF())
      were wrongly identifying the source of S4 methods in a package
      and so not checking them.

    o The default type of display by browseEnv() when using R.app on
      Mac OS X has been incorrect for a long time.

    o The implementation of importMethodsFrom in a NAMESPACE file could
      be confused and fail to find generics when importing from
      multiple packages (reported and fixed by Michael Lawrence).

    o The detection of the C stack direction is better protected
      against compiler optimization. (PR#15011.)

    o Long custom line types would sometimes segfault on the
      cairographics-based devices. (PR#15055.)

    o tools::checkPoFile() unprotected too early in its C code and so
      segfaulted from time to time.

    o The Fortran code underlying nlminb() could infinite-loop if any
      of the input functions returned NA or NaN.  This is now an error
      for the gradient or Hessian, and a warning for the function (with
      the value replaced by Inf).  (In part, PR#15052.)

    o The code for creating coerce() methods could generate false notes
      about ambiguous selection; the notes have been suppressed for
      this function.

    o arima.sim() could give too long an output in some corner cases
      (in part, PR#15068).

    o anova.glm() with test = "Rao" didn't work when models included an
      offset. (Reported by Soren Feodor Nielsen.)

    o as.data.frame.matrix() could return invalid data frame with no
      row.names attribute for 0-row matrix. (Reported by Herv'e Pag`es.)

    o Compilation with the vecLib or Accelerate frameworks on OS X
      without using that also for LAPACK is more likely to be
      successful.
