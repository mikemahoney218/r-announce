Subject: R-0.63.2 is released
Message-ID: <x2emp19al0.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've put up R-0.63.2.tgz up for FTP from Auckland some minutes ago.
As usual, don't get it from there unless you are desperate, but wait
for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who *are* desperate, I've left a copy in
	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.63.2.tgz 
(Be gentle, that's my desktop PC!)

There's also a version split in two for floppies and a patch file if
you prefer that.

This version is mainly to fix a messup with attributes on dataframe
variables that caused trouble for survival4. Completeness in
bug-fixing is not attempted.

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.63.2

NEW FEATURES

    o	sink() has new `append' argument.

    o	new function rle().

    o	plot(.) and  curve(.) also accept a function as first argument.
	new `plot.function'.

    o	new function loglin().

    o	pretty() has new arguments and now better "obeys" its `n' arg.
	Internal GPretty() [implicitly used by	axis(.., at = NULL,..)
	now uses pretty.

    o   new generic function aggregate() with methods for data frames
	and time series.

    o   data set `euro' with Euro conversion rates.

    o   new function jitter()  [slightly wmore useful than S's].


BUG FIXES

    o	model.frame(,subset=) no longer loses contrasts

    o	`make install' copied the R shell script a second time without
	getting RHOME right (thus also breaking R CMD check).  Fixed.

    o	help() after help.start() did not work if topic was not equal
	to filename (e.g. rnorm is found in Normal.html)

    o	fix the 0.63.1 fix for abbreviate(.);  improved doc.

    o	predict.mlm(.) couldn't have worked with `newdata'.

    o	model.frame/na.omit bug for matrices and Surv objects.

    o	mean( <data.frame> ) now doesn't return sum(.) anymore.

    o	str(.) doesn't give extraneous "..." in rare cases anymore.

    o	Added documentation for group methods ("Math", "Ops","Summary").

    o	R_PAPERSIZE is used for Rd2dvi and at configure time for the 
	`make dvi' parts.

    o	hist(i) now also works for e.g., i = -1, 0, or 1.

    o   range() now works on dataframes (uses c(..., recursive=T))

    o	pretty(.) does not loop infinitely anymore in very extreme cases.

    o   math functions should work better on dataframes now

    o	plot(.., type = 'h', log = 'y')	 now works ...

    o   plot.factor(x, y, ...) of two factors now makes
        barplot(table(y,x), ...)

    o   use object$prior.weights in add1.glm, drop1.glm (Brian Ripley)

    o   rnorm(1,mean=m,sd=0) returns m, not NaN (Ben Bolker)

    o   runif(n, a,a) now returns  rep(a,n) instead of NaNs.

Subject: R-0.63.2 for Windows
Message-ID: <19990120083700.18164@hal.stat.unipd.it>


I have updated to R-0.63.2 the version of R for Windows available from CRAN
in directory binaries/windows/WindowsNT/base. 

No new Windows specific features but:
(i)  I hope to have fixed the NT copy to the clipboard bug;
(ii) help files use latin1 encoding (but, to see the difference, 
you must use a latin1 capable font; for this reason, now, as packed, 
the R console uses "Courier New"; if you don't like it, edit etc/Rconsole). 

Pre-compiled packages for this version of R are provided by 
Brian D. Ripley (who, BTW, is also responsable for (ii) before,
thanks Brian!) and available at CRAN/binaries/WindowsNT/contrib.

(ps) Note that my e-mail address is changed. Please, use this not the 
old one.

Subject: R-bugs interfacing to R-devel mailing list
Message-ID: <x2ogn5p48b.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've been hacking at the JitterBug sources a little, so that it should
work better with mailing lists. It has been running with the core team
list for a while and seems to be OK.

I will now move the forwarding address to the r-devel list where it
really belongs. I hope this will make it easier for people outside the
core team to contribute to the development of R by participating in
the discussions and helping to analyse bug reports.

Points to note:

All entries (web or email) to R-bugs are echoed to R-devel, *except*
those marked "private" on the web form, and/or containing the word
PRIVATE (in uppercase) in the subject field.

The Reports arrive at R-devel with R-bugs in the Cc: field, so if you
reply to "sender and all recipients" (AKA "wide reply") the reply gets
registered as a followup in R-bugs. There is code in Jitterbug to
prevent the autoforwarding of messages which have already been copied
to R-devel, but note that if the original sender also reads R-devel,
he or she will still get the reply twice, so you may still need to
edit the headers.

Please do *not* Cc: bug reports to other lists. This will only cause
most people to receive it in two versions, one of which will be
lacking the Problem Report identifier (PR# xxx). If someone then
replies to "all recipients", this will open up a *new* Problem Report,
etc.

Subject: R-0.63.3 is released
Message-ID: <x2vhgfzzec.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've put up R-0.63.3.tgz up for FTP from Auckland some minutes ago.
As usual, don't get it from there unless you are desperate, but wait
for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who *are* desperate, I've left a copy in
	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.63.3.tgz 
(Be gentle, that's my desktop PC!)

There's also a version split in two for floppies and a patch file if
you prefer that.

A special <mumble> with the patch file this time is that some binary
Java .class files got changed and can NOT be patched in. They are
provided separately in R-0.63.3-javaclass.tgz (to be unpacked in
../doc/html/search ).

We've been fairly active trying to eradicate a lot of minor bugs this
time, although a couple of nontrivial ones still remain. The next
version is likely to be 0.64.0, with Macintosh and Gnome support as
the major new features.

	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.63.3

    o	New options `latexcmd' and `dvipscmd' for specifying the locations
	of LaTeX and dvips; corresponding environment variables renamed to
	`R_LATEXCMD' and `R_DVIPSCMD'.

    o	--vsize & --nsize now both give size in "single units" 
	(bytes/cons cells) with possible 
	suffixes "M" (Mega), "K"ilo (1024) and "k"ilo(1000).

    o	[pdqr]negbin() now also work with non-integer 'size' [by Ben Bolker].

    o	qqnorm() uses ppoints() and returns list with x sorted along y.

    o	plot.formula now allows ylab to be set

    o	plotmath had trouble with paste()'ing expressions

    o	plotting math expressions now also works for objects of mode
	"call" (in particular on the result of substitute())

    o	(a real oldie - and trival too) is.recursive now TRUE for
	expressions 

    o	sanitised delete.response

    o	x[["a",]] could crash R

    o	strwidth() crashed R if no device open

    o	predict inconsistencies with offsets straightened out

    o	tapply goofed when FUN returned named scalar

    o	[.factor now retains contrasts attrib.

    o	hist() had trouble with plotting math

    o	HTML indices get only built when installing a package to RHOME

    o	subscripting with a length zero logical no longer bombs.

    o	as.ordered(NULL) now returns an "ordered" object.

    o	bug.report() keeps report file if can't be e-mailed

    o	Ops.data.frame :  things like  d.fr < a	  now return a matrix

    o	data.frame():  duplicated row.names now give a warning when dropped.

    o	boxplot(.., ylim=..) or (.., axes=..)  gave erronous warning

    o	glm had wrong init code for models with offsets. Also fixed
	so that linear predictor includes offset, also when predicting. 

    o	predict.glm didn't work with se=T

    o	backsolve(), qr.solve... now return a vector when x (or y) is a vector.

    o	string tags now converted to symbols and strange symbolic
	tags print as strings, cf. e<-quote(c(F=2, "tail area" = .5)), etc. 

    o	row.names(.) <- val  doesn't allow duplicated values anymore.

    o	library(mva)'s dist() now works with both "euclidean" & "euclidian"

    o	revised curve function to avoid using grep patterns that caused
	problems under Solaris 2.6
 
    o	coplot() now has 'number' and 'overlap' arguments, and should work
	in more situations. [by John Maindonald and MM].

    o	save(..ascii=TRUE) now uses "full precision" for numerics.

    o	as.array() preserves names()

    o	outer() works for general array args and preserves (dim)names.

    o	print.factor and print.ordered now return their args invisibly.

Subject: R0.63.3 for Win9X/NT available at CRAN
Message-ID: <19990318084914.54359@hal.stat.unipd.it>


Windows binaries and source at CRAN (bin/windows/Windows-NT/base) have
been updated to R-0.63.3 (now at Wien, in one/two days to the
other mirrors). 

WINDOWS NEWS:
============

The beginnings of a FAQ (RHOME/rw-faq).

Programs can be launched from all shells: the full path to the
executable is not needed.

Configurable fonts in the graphics devices by the file Rdevga (?Rdevga).

Workspaces are saved in XDR format, and so can be shared with most
Unix implementations of R.

Printer and metafile graphics devices (?win.print and ?win.metafile).

Consistent handling of start directory for dialogs and the working
directory across versions of R. Improved handling of R directories 
via the new environmental variable R_HOME (look to the README).

An improved and enhanced system() function (?system and ?shell). 

Windows-specific help files where necessary.

Better support for ESS.

Better support for the installation of pre-compiled packages
(?link.html.help)

=================================================================


Pre-compiled packages for this version of R are provided by 
Brian D. Ripley and available CRAN/binaries/Windows-NT/contrib.

Hallo all,
 The package "cclust" applying convex clustering methods contains now
a new function called "clustindex" calculating the values of several
clustering indexes. The values of the indexes can be independently used in
order to determine the number of clusters existing in a data set.
For anybody interested the new version of the "cclust" package can be
found at CRAN.

Subject: R-0.64.0 is released
Message-ID: <x2emlw8nbt.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've put up R-0.64.0.tgz up for FTP from Auckland a little while ago.
As usual, don't get it from there unless you are desperate, but wait
for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who *are* desperate, I've left a copy in
	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.64.0.tgz 
(Be gentle, that's my desktop PC!)

There's also a version split in two for floppies if you prefer that.

We haven't been very active removing minor bugs this time, but there
are a couple of new features that we wanted to get out in the open.

	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.64.0

NEW FEATURES

    o   Files BUGS and FAQ are now included with distribution and
	various "front matter" files have been cleaned up.

    o	readline has now an argument  prompt = ""

    o	coplot() now labels levels when conditioning variable is factor
	(John Maindonald).

    o	A new function filled.contour() has been added.	 It produces
	a variant of contour plots where the area between contours
	is filled with a solid colour.	The function (currently)
	uses the layout() function and so is restricted to a full
	page display.

    o	The function terrain.colors() has been modified to remove a
	visual discontinuity (at yellow).  In addition, a function
	cm.colors() which implements a Cleveland-style cyan-magenta
	palette has been added.

    o	Primitive function .External() to call dynamically loaded
	`internal'-style functions (code from Jean Meloche).

    o	Function page() to view an R object in a pager.

    o	Support for handling embedded '\n's in text strings
	handed to low-level graphics functions has been added.
	Some changes to the PostScript graphics driver were
	needed to support this, so there may some minor change
	in the appearance of plots produced in PostScript.

    o	The LaTeX documentation is now split into 2 parts: the (currently
	almost non-existent) manual and a reference index.
	Manual: new section on loading C++ code.

    o	[EXPERIMENTAL] Gnome support added. Use ./configure --with-gnome
	to try it, but don't expect too much yet.

    o   HDF5 support improved. Still not perfect, though.

    o	The X11 graphics driver can now use a variety of strategies
	for handing color.  This means that it is now possible to
	use black and white or grayscale graphics on color displays.
	There are two strategies for handing color on pseudocolor
	displays.  The original "allocate-colors-until-they-run-out"
	strategy has been supplemented by one which allocates a
	color cube at startup and approximates requested colors
	by those in the cube.  On truecolor displays, there is no
	limit on the number of colors which can be displayed and
	you get exactly the color you request.	(Note that
	Directcolor and staticcolor displays are not supported yet).

    o	The "persp" function now allows shading of the rendered
	surface using a simple lighting model.

    o	Many functions providing an interface to the operating system
	have been made "platform independent".	See the manual entries
	for "file", "list.files" and "file.show" for details of the new
	interface. The system.file() interface has been changed.

    o	There is a new function "eval.with.vis" which behaves exactly
	like "eval", but which returns both the result of the evaluation
	an a logical value indicating whether the value is ``visible''.
	This has been used to replace some ad-hoc tests for whether
	value should be printed or not in "source".  As a consequence,
	the "example" and "demo" functions no longer print invisible
	values when the example script is run.

    o   Index files in data directories in packages should be `00Index'
	not `index.doc'.

    o   Function interaction() to compute factor interactions.

    o   load() can load to specific environments.

    o	Sockets interface: make/read/write/close.socket()

    o	Function chull() for planar convex hulls

    o	pairs.formula() allows formula notations for scatter plot matrix.

    o   new dataset co2.

    o   documentation for datasets mtcars, plants, pressure, randu and sleep.

    o   the sunspots dataset is now monthly rather than annual.

BUG FIXES

    o   strsplit(), scan() and friends use a much larger char buffer
	 (still fixed size; this will change again)

    o   ts() allows a data-frame argument `data'.

    o   anova.lm handles singular models better, and deparses responses.

    o   dump() now uses digits=12 rather than the current setting.

    o   tabulate ignores entries beyond nbins rather than core dumps.

    o	?.C documents what C/Fortran types R objects correspond to
	in foreign function calls, which is not what everyone thought.

    o	changed long to int in several .C calls to follow the above rules.

    o	rbind(x1,x2) now does not lose dimnames when xi are 
	character or complex.

    o	readline() accidentally inherited menu()'s prompt.

    o	.C() and .Fortran() now correctly report that there might be
	NaN/Infs, not just NAs, unless NAOK=TRUE.

    o	Resizing an inactive graphics window to an invalid size left
	that window active and produced a spurious prompt and newline
	in the console window.	This no longer happens.

    o	poly() rescales x to increase accuracy

    o	apply() preserves names in yet another case [-> new example].

    o	phyper() now works for larger arguments than before.

    o	Missing values didn't work in log plot

    o	outer() doesn't produce all-empty dimnames any more

    o	quantile.default() works when `probs' has zero length

    o	example() now works again in all cases [AnIndex spaces].

    o	typos fixed in nlm() message, glm help

    o	pt() now works better for extreme `df' arguments and gives
	at least an approximate answer for ncp > 37.6. __more to change__

    o	fixed some glitches with formatC() and its docs.

    o	several fixes in *.c code to make -Wall happy

    o	curve() [and plot.function()] now use proper `x' values with log="x";
	`type = "."' now works with curve() and plot.function()

Subject: R-0.64 versions of packages
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.9904110840390.3678-100000@auk.stats>


Versions of

	KernSmooth
	VR5.3pl037
	boot
	gee
	rpart
	sm   (delete src/Makefile: I'll get the version on CRAN changed)
	tree

for R-0.64 are now on CRAN. Please note that spatial (in the VR bundle)
and sm really do need 0.64 as we use the platform-independent file
handling, and sm uses chull.

This will be the last version of the VR5.x software for the second 
edition, as a new more `R friendly' third edition is due out in July. The
software for that is now available for pretest (including for R-0.64 on
UNix and Windows) at

	http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS3

It is almost completely backwards compatible (just no support for
survival4) with eariler versions but has new datasets and functions.
Some, such as ppr and lqs, are already in R.


Windows versions:
=================

I have split the Windows contributed collection into current and
rw063x sections: the mirroring on CRAN caught the middle of the change
but should be complete by tomorrow when we plan to release rw0640.
One nice new feature is the larger packages can have their help and 
examples files stored in zip archives, thereby saving a lot of space on
some file systems.

Subject: R-0.64.0 for Win9X/WinNT 
Message-ID: <19990413090852.35944@hal.stat.unipd.it>


Windows binaries and source at CRAN (binaries/windows/Windows-NT/base) 
have been updated to R-0.64.0.
Pre-compiled packages for this version of R are provided by 
Brian D. Ripley and available CRAN/binaries/Windows-NT/contrib.
Brian Ripley is also mantaining a FAQ for this version of R 
(linked in the main R FAQ at CRAN or available directly
at http:/www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/rw-FAQ.html).

WINDOWS NEWS:
============

R-0.64 uses platform-independent code for file handling. Files are
displayed under a pager in a separate window rather than in the
console. 

Environment variables can be set as NAME=value on the command line,
including in a short-cut.

Content of the pager and of the Rgui's console can be printed
by File | Print.

The help, latex and example files can be stored in zip files to save
space; this is used for the base package.

The menus are enabled/disabled and check-marked correctly under NT.
We hope to have solved the 'rw0633 font dimension problem'  shown
under some NT version.

read.fwf works if you have Perl installed.

help(, offline=TRUE) will work if you have latex installed and
customize RHOME/bin/helpPRINT.bat. The optional rw0640l.zip
contains the latex sources.

The sockets code is compiled in, but we have not tested it.

system() has new arguments `invisible' and `minimized'.

Subject: Future directions of R for Windows?
Message-ID: <199904151718.SAA08847@toucan.stats.ox.ac.uk>



Now rw0640 is released, we have achieved our main goal of being able to
build easily new versions from the Unix sources, and the R functionality is
as complete a copy as we can achieve easily.  We are now thinking of
possible enhancements, and would like your comments on the following ideas.

   o   Use a standard MDI interface like MS Office's, say. Would you 
       prefer an MDI interface to the current one, and if so is the
       `standard' `look and feel' important?

   o   Replace the help system by standard Windows help files. Would
       you like this instead of text help, html help or both?
       
   o   rw0640 implements offline printing via latex.  Do you anticipate
       using this?  (It needs lots of extra files.)  Would printing from
       a Windows help file be an adequate replacement?
       
   o   Build an R dll that can be linked into other applications to drive
       effectively an R command-line by passing input strings. Possibly
       versions without and without on-screen graphics.
       
   o   Implement inter-process communications, either
   
       -  Windows-style (DDE and ActiveX automation) or
       -  CORBA-style  (real standards)
       
       This might allow R to be called from a spreadsheet or Visual Basic 
       front-end, for example.
       
   o   Would you prefer an installer as well as / instead of the 
       current set of smallish zip files?
       
   o   How important is it that R can be built from source with free
       tools?  (We are not contemplating requiring any new tools to
       install packages, but a Windows-standard interface probably 
       requires a commercial compiler with MFC.)

We would also welcome other suggestions.  Some of this appears easy,
some rather hard, so there are no guarantees that anything will be done.

I am posting this to R-announce to reach most Windows users of R: PLEASE
reply directly to Guido and I, or cc only R-devel.

Subject: "Advanced Programming in S" short course 
In-Reply-To: Bill Venables's message of "Sat, 17 Apr 1999 12:18:40 +0930 (CST)"
Message-ID: <6rzp3mvslm.fsf_-_@verdi.stat.wisc.edu>


The Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison
will be presenting a two-day short course on "Advanced Programming in
S" by Dr. William Venables, June 14-15, 1999 in Madison, Wisconsin,
USA.

Details are available at
	  http://www.stat.wisc.edu/shortcourse/Venables.html
or by contacting Denise Roder <roder at stat.wisc.edu>.

In the title of the short course, "S" refers to the language, not a
specific product.  We regard S-PLUS and R as two dialects of the S
language.  Bill will be discussing both although, to be honest, the
emphasis will be on S-PLUS.

Subject: R-0.64.1 is released 
Message-ID: <x23e18udby.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've put up R-0.64.1.tgz up for FTP from Auckland some a moment ago.
As usual, don't get it from there unless you are desperate, but wait
for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who *are* desperate, I'll put a copy in

	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.64.1.tgz 

There's also a version split in two for floppies and a patch file if
you prefer that. (The patch file misses out on some binary files that
have been added since 0.64.0, but you only need them for compiling the
Windows version).

	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:



                CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.64.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   barplot() and boxplot() are now generic

    o   relevel function to reorder levels in factors.

    o   contr.treatment now has a base= argument for selecting the
        baseline group.

    o   New command line option `--no-environ' (under Unix) to prevent
        sourcing the `~/.Renviron' file.  Implied by `--vanilla'.

    o   Packages can now have a configure script.  If a file `configure'
        is found it is executed before anything else is done by R
        INSTALL.

    o   If HTML help files are asked for but not available, text help 
        is used. 

    o   HTML help file conversion reports unsatisified \link{..}s. 

    o   `vsize' and `nsize' can be set by the environment variables
        R_VSIZE and R_NSIZE respectively, perhaps most conveniently from
        `~/.Renviron' under Unix or Windows.  Command-line settings will
        take precedence.

        The defaults have been increased to 6M and 250k.

    o   zip files can be used for storing help and example files. See
        the help files for "help" and "example" for details.

    o   New submission method "none" (for not sending email) in
        bug.report().

    o   `R CMD check' can now also be used for installed packages without
        the corresponding sources.

    o   The sources for the Windows port are included in src/gnuwin32.
        See src/gnuwin32/readme.

BUG FIXES

    o   deparser left off empty parentheses on e.g. (function(x) x)()

    o   cat() now works on "name" objects

    o   forgot to set jump buffer in return context in one case

    o   parser dropped off tagged missing args on function calls ( f(a=) )

    o   relops tried to set time series parameters before dimensions

    o   arithmetic tried to set time series parameters before dimensions

    o   mvfft fixes (from Martyn Plummer) - not working with vectors and
        segfault problem.

    o   Rephrased error message on invalid assignment target.

    o   ifelse() now evaluates yes/no only if needed

    o   PROTECT'ed some memory in NewExtractNames that was getting overwritten
        during garbage collection.

    o   Crossing factors (`:') works again.

    o   terms.formula used to choke on terms more than 60 characters long

    o   is.nan() should now work correctly on new/old-style lists.

    o   x[[i]] did not work correctly for negative subscripts i.

    o   as.list() didn't work for expressions

    o   x[[i]] <- quote(a) (x generic vector) didn't work

    o   for method functions: many argument name changes, add ... where
        needed, for consistency with the generic function.

    o   example() will allow (again) aliased topic names. 

    o   HTML help file conversions will find hyperlinks in the main 
        library as well as the current library. Links containing `<'
        or `>' now work properly.

    o   Rdconv conversion of \section{}{}s to Sd corrected.

    o   ppois rounded non-integer `q', should truncate.

    o   pnbinom was wrong for non-integer `q'.

    o   dbinom, dgeom, dnbinom, dpois give 0 with a warning for
        non-integer arguments.

    o   load / save / data allow unlimited string sizes.

    o   strsplit() allows unlimited string size.

    o   eigen() now should work (again) in all cases.

    o   is.nan() fixed to work (again) in architectures with 
        "unspecified" internal isnan().

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.9905101134080.16882-100000@wompom.biostat.washington.edu>



Version 1.0 of survival5 will soon be percolating through CRAN.

Survival5 is the R port of the newest version of Terry Therneau's survival
analysis code for S(-PLUS).  It contains a number of bug fixes relative to
survival4, a more robust parametric likelihood maximiser, updated US
mortality ratetables, and facilities for penalised maximum (partial)
likelihood.

The R port REQUIRES version 0.64.1 or later. It also requires the splines
package, and the date package is strongly recommended.

Some further documentation is available in Mayo Clinic technical reports
from:
 http://www.mayo.edu/hsr/main/people/therneau.html

Please send questions about the R port to me, not to Terry Therneau, since
most of the major changes since survival4 are implemented incompatibly in
R and S.

Subject: Red Hat Linux/Intel 6.0 RPMS for R
Message-ID: <XFMail.990604094113.plummer@iarc.fr>


RPMs of R-0.64.1 are now available for Red Hat Linux/Intel 6.0.
They should be mirrored to a CRAN site near you over the weekend.
If you are desperate you can get them now from:

ftp://ftp-fis.iarc.fr/pub/R/RedHat/6.0/i386

GNOME SUPPORT
-------------
If you have GNOME installed, then use the "R-base-gnome" package.
Otherwise just use the "R-base" package. This is change from the
previous arrangement in which GNOME support for R was distributed
as a separate add-on package.

Don't install both R-base and R-base-gnome.

PGP
---
This is a good opportunity to tell you, if you haven't noticed already,
that the RPM packages are PGP signed. You can pick up my public key
from

Message-ID: <XFMail.990611124121.plummer@iarc.fr>


A small package called "bats" is now available in the "Devel" directory
of CRAN.  This contains time series functions  which are not wholly
unlike the ones found in S-PLUS

It currently does 
- Autocorrelation function estimation (acf, plot.acf)
- Spectral density estimation (spec.pgram, plot.spec)
- Autoregressive modelling (ar.yw)
All the functions handle multivariate time series.

Testing and feedback would be most welcome.

Hi,

on suggestion by Robert Gentleman we want to add a

	``Other R-related sites''

collection of links to CRAN, where we give pointers to non-CRAN sites
that might be of interest to R users. E.g., this could be pages in
some language other than English supporting the respective user
community or ...

If you think your site could appear in such a collection, please
send email to me and I will be happy to include it.

Best,
Fritz

Subject: New packages (tcl/tk <-> R glue + Visual Tcl)

	       [Reposted by R-announce-owner because of  R-announce protection.
		Guido is subscribed under a different E-mail..]

I have made available in the 'Contributed R code | Devel' section of CRAN 
(in this moment only at Wien) two new packages:

'tcltk': this package let to create and use tcl/tk interpreters
         from R.  The tcl interpreters have an additional command 
         'R some R commands' which let to execute R commands, e.g, 
         'R a<-rnorm(100)'.  This can be used to define button's
         call-backs,... This package requires tcl/tk (tested only
         with versions 8.0 and 8.1) installed. Please, look to the
         README before installation. Status of this package is alpha. 

'vtcl': it contains only one function 'visual.tcl()' which let to exec
        Visual Tcl (http://www.neuron.com/stewart/vtcl) from R.
        Visual Tcl is a Rapid Application Development (RAD)
        environment which in particular let to build interactively the user 
        interface.  Visual Tcl is included in the package.
        This package is as stable as Visual Tcl is (which,
        IMO, means quite stable). However, it depends from tcltk.
        For this reason, it is in the devel section.

I will be happy to hear comments, suggestions, ... . 
I also hope that someone else will find the time to contribute to the 
development.

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Fri Jul  2 16:25:08 1999
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 02 Jul 1999 16:25:08 +0200
Subject: R-0.64.2 is released (well, mostly)
Message-ID: <x2wvwjb03f.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-0.64.2.tgz a moment ago.

However, due to a configuration error with the new machine at
Auckland, it is not up for FTP from there just yet. In any case, you
shouldn't get it from Auckland, but wait for it to be mirrored at a
CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who are too curious to wait, I've put a copy in

	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.64.2.tgz 

There's also a version split in two for floppies and a patch file if
you prefer that.

	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.



Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.64.2

NEW FEATURES

    o	new target for R installation testing :	 make strict-tests.

    o	symnum(x) now nicely codes logical x.

    o	convolve() has a new type = c("circular", "open", "filter")
	argument allowing more than the only circular convolution.

    o	par(xpd) now has three settings:  FALSE (clip to plot region),
	TRUE (clip to figure region), or NA (clip to device region).

    o	zapsmall(x) works for complex x.

    o	new global variable R.version.string (for plots & reports).
	Deprecated version & Version for new  R.version & R.Version.

    o	R CMD Rd2dvi  has builtin "Usage" help and works for multiple files.
	Useful for automatic reference manual of a package.
	(doc/manual/lib2tex is more efficient for installed packages, however).


BUG FIXES

    o	power() is now fully implemented and documented.

    o   A couple of problems with group generic operations.

    o   A bug which meant that it was not possible to add elements
        to zero length lists in the obvious way has been fixed.
                x <- list(); x[[1]] <- 10
                x <- list(); x[["a"]] <- 11
        both now work.

    o	save.image() ignored dot-names. (esp. .First())

    o   lab= argument to plot() misinterpreted by axis() via ... passing

    o	NULL labels in text() caused segfault

    o   matrix(f,...) with f a factor now coerces to character

    o   documentation errors for substitute and is.vector, minor fixups for
        trig and nlm 

    o	Background colours are set properly on X11 devices with 
	colortype="pseudo": sometimes they were not allocated separately.

    o	C() works (again?) for a single argument.

    o	is.na() didn't work properly for "list" arguments.

    o	symnum() sometimes failed with arrays of rank >= 3.

    o	in some cases one could get nonblack color instead of
	black on 2nd x11() window.

    o	influence.measures(.) $ is.influential was wrong on the 
	cooks.distance.

    o	printing of complex NaN/Inf was wrong as well.

    o	printing of complex named vectors had a wrong initial space.

    o	allow trailing space in character->numeric coercion

    o	library() gave wrong "masked" warnings in some cases.

    o	par(xpd) semantics were not compatible with S.

    o	rect() output was not clipped in PostScript.

    o	par(pin=c(width, height)) was behaving as par(pin=c(width, width)).

    o	Non-blank separated data files didn't have their 1st field
	handled properly.

    o	"aux" directory moved to "tools" to avoid difficulties on
	Windows.

    o	structure() clobbered factors with missing levels.

    o	pmatch() misbehaved on duplicate matches.

    o	R CMD Rd2dvi <file.Rd> works again.

    o	logical binops tried to set time series parameters before dimensions.

    o	upped the BUFSIZE in model.c (NOT proper long-term solution).

    o	dput(), dump() and deparse()  now always use DBL_DIG (=15) digits
	for numeric formatting.

    o	chull() now works for vertical borders, such as in chull(c(1,1,2),3:1).

Hi,

due to some FTP problems in Auckland and me not being in office
yesterday R 0.64.2 took some time to travel from Denmark to New
Zealand and then back to Europe ... but now it is finally available at
the CRAN master site

	http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/R

here in Vienna and it should propagate to the
various miroors within the next 24 hours or so.

Subject: New smoothing spline package gss
Message-ID: <199907061640.LAA54480@mean.stat.purdue.edu>



Dear fellow R users,

I just uploaded a new package gss to ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at.  The package
name gss stands for General Smoothing Spline.

In the current version (0.4-1), it handles nonparametric multivariate
regression with Gaussian, Binomial, Poisson, Gamma, Inverse Gaussian,
and Negative Binomial responses.  I am still working on code for
density estimation and hazard rate estimation to be made available in
future releases.

On the modeling side, gss uses tensor-product smoothing splines to
construct nonparametric ANOVA structures using cubic spline, linear
spline, and thin-plate spline marginals.  The popular
(main-effect-only) additive models are special cases of nonparametric
ANOVA models.  The syntax of gss functions resembles that of the lm
and glm suites.

Among new features that are not available from other spline packages
are the standard errors needed for the construction of Wahba's Bayesian
confidence intervals for smoothing spline fits, so you may want to try
out gss even if you only wants to calculate a univariate cubic spline
or a single term thin-plate spline.

For those familiar with smoothing splines, gss is a front end to
RKPACK, which encodes O(n^3) generic algorithms for reproducing kernel
based smoothing spline calculation.

Reports on bugs and suggestions for improvements/new features are most
welcome.

Subject: Win9X/NT binaries updated
Message-ID: <19990707112029.33708@hal.stat.unipd.it>


A binary distribution of R-0.64.2 for Windows is available at 
CRAN/bin/windows/windows-NT.
There are few Windows-specific enhancements: rw0642 (and R-0.64.2) is
a bug-fixing release.

CHANGES
=======

If options(pager="console") then files are listed in the console
window, as happened prior to rw0640.

On request, we have enabled `pagerstyle = singlewindow' in MDI mode,
although we do not recommend this combination.

The file HOME\.Renviron is read (it was HOME\Renviron, and the
documentation used both names). Only the last line was successfully
processed in rw0641, but all lines are in this version.

unlink() on non-existent files no longer causes a crash.

The new function win.version() will report details of the run-time
Windows version, principally for use in bug.report().

bug.report() has a new argument wait: wait=FALSE gives a non-modal editor
screen.

Generally TAB will move between fields in dialog boxes, and return and
escape will work (selecting OK and Cancel) in the Change Directory
dialog box.

The installer will allow several packages to be selected, and will
install them in sequence. It should give more informative messages on
some error conditions. Usually return will select Next or Finish,
escape will select Cancel and B Back.

There is a new target `make check' for running the standard tests and 
checking the standard packages (as on Unix).

Saving the content of a graphic device as GIF should work again 
(saving of an image with less than 256 colours was broken in rw0641).

and should be more or less well documented. The library is a port of a
part of my
octave time series library, and, at the moment it does not contain
routines for
estimating particular time series models. However, I plan to port my VAR
routines (Johansen
MLE methodology) and to implement MLE of ARMA models within the next few
months. Finally,
thanks to Ross: I used some of his ideas to implement the "tsparam" and
the "kernel" classes.

Testing, suggestions, and comments are welcome!

Hi,

du to construction work in our rooms and some hardware/software
upgrades the CRAN master site in Vienna will be down several times
within the next fortnight.

First shutdown will be this afternoon, when we relocate the server to
another room. Another shutdown will be during most of Sunday, when the
complete building will have no electricity at all.

Best,

Hi,

Evgenia and I have copied an updated version of the mlbench package to
CRAN which contains several new data sets. We have also changed some
of the variable names to avoid name conflicts.

Best,

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Fri Aug 27 15:06:46 1999
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 27 Aug 1999 15:06:46 +0200
Subject: R-0.65.0 is released
Message-ID: <x21zcpnzix.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-0.65.0.tgz a moment ago.

You shouldn't get it from Auckland, but wait for it to be mirrored at
a CRAN site near you within a day or two. With the current transfer
speed from Auckland, you probably don't need a deterrent anyway...

For those who are too curious to wait, I'll put a copy in

	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.65.0.tgz 

There's also a version split in two for floppies if you prefer that.

	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.


The relevant part of the NEWS file follows below. In addition, GNOME
support, although still experimental, has been considerably improved.
You'll need a substantial amount of support libraries, see the INSTALL
file for details.

NEW FEATURES

    o	A first step in improving performance has been made.
	Attached objects, libraries etc are now hashed; performance
	gains will be particularly apparent if large packages are in use.

    o	First version of package ts for time-series analysis.
	This has fairly complete S-PLUS compatibility, but more features
	are planned. See library(help=ts) for details.

    o	warnings can be collected (options(warn=0), the default), printed
	immediately (options(warn=1)) or turned into errors (options(warn=2)).
	As a consequence, all warnings and errors now are printed followed
	by a newline, if one is not supplied. (This should improve the
	S compatibility of the use of PROBLEM ... in compiled code.)



    o	All R environment variables are now of the form `R_xxx'.  In
	particular, `RHOME', `RLIBS' and `RPROFILE' are now called
	`R_HOME', `R_LIBS', and `R_PROFILE'.

    o	The handling of q()/quit()/EOF has been changed, with a new option
	"default".  In interactive use this asks unless --save or --no-save
	has been specified: if these are specified they set the default.

    o	Limited capability for tilde expansion of file names even without
	readline (on Unix, and on Windows).

    o	New environment variables `R_HISTFILE' and `R_HISTSIZE' for the
	name and size of the history file.

    o	Attempting to restore (at startup) too large a .RData is now
	a fatal error.

    o	The loading of shared library on Unix now uses RTLD_NOW not
	RTLD_LAZY.  This means that all symbols must be resolvable
	when the library is loaded, and R will not terminate later
	when a missing symbol is called.  Code which had missing symbols
	(including some packages) will need to be re-compiled.



    o	New generic function all.equal();
	most useful for numerical comparisons `up to rounding errors'.

    o	New function boxplot.formula() as a formula interface to boxplots.

    o	New functions getwd() and setwd() for getting and setting the R
	working directory, basename() and dirname() for manipulating paths.

    o	Function locator(, type=) is implemented to plot points or
	draw lines interactively.

    o	Functions new.env() to create empty environment and local() to
	allow local evaluation of expressions, with various useful
	idiomatic uses.

    o	Convenience functions parent.frame() and eval.parent().



    o	A new scheme for keeping source code with user-defined
	functions has been implemented. In particular, comments
	will no longer move about or disappear. The flip side of the
	coin is that you can no longer rely on R to indent your
	code for you. The stored-source facility can be turned
	off with options(keep.source=FALSE), and for an individual
	function by deleting the "source" attribute.

	If the source attribute is absent, the function will be
	deparsed for editing or printing, but any comments will be
	lost.

    o	expressions have gained semantics that are closer to
	those of S. They don't get evaluated except when explicitly
	specified. Example:

	e <- expression(x); e[[1]] <- expression(123); eval(e)

	now gives expression(123), not 123. This fixes some problems
	with expressions in the list argument to do.call().



    o	contrast() no longer drops colnames for 1DF contrasts.
	Consequentially, the labels of regression coefficients for binary
	factors contain level names (again ...).

    o	na.omit() and na.fail() are now generic.

    o	plot.lm() has more options and now does 4 plots by default, should
	also be okay for "glm" object; all thanks to John Maindonald.

    o	If the dimnames of a table are themselves named, then their names
	are used to label the respective dimensions in tabular output.

    o	chisq.test() now optionally computes the p-value by Monte Carlo
	simulation (in the standard case of a 2-d contigency table).

    o	source() has a new argument `chdir' for changing the working
	directory to that of the file being sourced when evaluating.

    o	If data() loads an R source file, it now changes the working
	directory (to that containing the file) when evaluating.

    o	Interpret strings NaN and Inf in character to numeric conversions
	(and thereby in read.table)

    o	The presence of an object `.conflicts.OK' in a package suppresses
	conflict checking in library() for that package.

    o	uniroot() can now be used recursively.

    o	hdf5{read|write} now allow more kinds of attributes and add support
	for HDF5 version 1.2 (or newer)	thanks to Marcus G. Daniels.
	Configure checks for HDF5 1.2 availability, older versions will 
	no longer work. 



BUG FIXES

    o	x ^ y  gives proper results when x or y are infinite.

    o	The semantics of <<- have been corrected.  The search for
	a variable binding to modify now begins one level "up" from
	the current one.   Thus S and R semantics in "non-closure"
	functions will be identical.

    o	.Last() is called when terminating with q() (not just with EOF).

    o	abline() now understands the "lwd" graphics parameter if it
	is supplied as an inline argument.

    o	axis() now sorts `labels' when it sorts `at'.

    o	Some small changes have made in the axis drawing code to
	ensure that tick-mark label alignment is correct for
	non-default values of the "las" parameter.

    o	Improved error message from check.options().

    o	cm.colors(n) now doesn't append silly "v=1"; works for n=0, n=1.

    o	cooks.distance() now also works for "glm" objects;
	deviance.lm() now ok for the case of weights.

    o	date() doesn't return a final "\n" (again ...).

    o	diag() and diag<- now handle correctly matrices with zero rows or cols.

    o	help([<-.factor) (etc) work again.

    o	is.recursive(list(.)) is now TRUE [PR#221].

    o	log(0) gives -Inf on all architectures.

    o	When persp() was the first graphics command given to R it gave
	the error "plot.new() has not been called yet".  This no
	longer happens.

    o	pgamma() gave 0 or 1 for extreme arguments too soon.

    o	plot(<function>, log="x") doesn't give a silly warning any more.

    o	The internals of postscript() have been changed so that line
	textures (dotted dashed etc) look better.  The use of the
	PostScript "initclip" operator has been removed so that we
	can(?) really claim eps compliance.

    o	revsort() misbehaved if n<=1, causing sample(1,1,,1) to
	segfault

    o	seq(along = v) { and seq(v) when length(v) > 1 } now returns
	a result of mode "integer".

    o	split.default() now uses subscripting for x with a non-null
	class, this preserves, e.g., the class of factors

    o	substr/substring(), deparse(), dput(), dump(), print()
	will work for arbitrarily long strings.

    o	which(x) failed when x had names and contained NAs.

    o	Default editor files (e.g. from fix()) are now removed at termination.

    o	Typos in NegBinomial.Rd (Negative Binomial distrib), thanks to Ch. Gu.

    o	a clipping problem for plots when there non-zero outer margins
	has been fixed.	 This problem used to affect coplot() and pairs().

    o   get("zzz", mode="xxx") missed promise objects.

    o   match.fun failed when a data frame was attached containing a 
	"length" variable (e.g.)

Subject: Windows port of R-0.65.0
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.9908272103050.28360-100000@auk.stats>


Guido Masarotto is currently in hospital and so will be unable to make an
official release in the near future. I am putting a preliminary release in
the windows/window-NT/contrib/rw0650 area of CRAN (it will be in Vienna in
the early hours and propagate from there) of the rw0650x zip files. I am
not able to check this as thoroughly as Guido and I can together, so please
let me know of any problems.

The main changes in the Windows version are internal; these are extensive
and should result in better responsiveness, especially from rterm.exe.
R-0.65.0 itself has extensive changes, internally as well as user-visible.

The new features some of you requested will have to wait until Guido
is back on stream.

If you are desparate, the files are mirrored from

Subject: R-0.65.1 is released
Message-ID: <x2vh8ktyn2.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-0.65.1.tgz a moment ago.

As usual, you shouldn't get it from Auckland, but wait for it to be
mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who are too curious to wait, I'll put a copy in

	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.65.1.tgz 

There's also a version split in two for floppies and a patch file if
you prefer that. (If you use the patch file, you will miss a logo.bmp
file in the gnuwin32 directory, but that is probably immaterial to
most of you).

	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.



Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.65.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	.C, .Fortran. .Call and .External now have an argument PACKAGE
	to specify the shared library to be used for the symbol. See
	?Foreign. Package writers are encouraged to use this.

    o	On startup (unless --no-environ), first .Renviron is looked for in
	the current directory, and then in $HOME/ (= ~/ ).

    o	New options(error.halt = FALSE) (default is TRUE) allows
	continuation after an error in batch processing.

    o	In graphics, lty has now 6 instead of 4 predefined line types.

    o	as.hclust.twins() in package mva to convert (and plot)
	objects from agnes() and daisy() of package cluster.

    o	R INSTALL now can directly install pkg_version.tar.gz files
	as obtained from CRAN. New function update.packages()
	& friends for automatically downloading packages from CRAN and
	install them on the fly (on Unix and Windows).

    o	New function commandArgs() to record the command-line used.

    o	New arguments `local' and `now' to dyn.load.

    o	diag(x) now keeps names when appropriate and barfs when x is an array.

    o	functions source.url, url.show, read.table.url, scan.url to read
	from an http server instead of a file.

    o	grid() gets useful defaults: grid lines drawn at tick marks.

    o	set operations union(), intersect(), setdiff() and is.element().

    o	New function stars() for star plots and segment diagrams of
	multivariate data.

    o	Version info now in the top-level file `VERSION'.

    o	barplot has a "plot = TRUE" argument and now returns locations of
	all bars even when "beside = TRUE".

    o	hist has an "nclass" argument purely for S compatibility.

    o	Character strings can now, with most compilers, be passed
	on and from Fortran. See ?Foreign for details.

    o	Functions as.single and single now have the effect with
	.C and .Fortran of passing a numeric argument as float/REAL
	rather than as double/DOUBLE PRECISION, by setting the
	attribute "Csingle". See ?Foreign for details.

    o	Comparison of strings uses the current locale on systems where
	this is available, and so is always consistent with the ordering
	used by sort().

    o	sapply  has a new argument USE.NAMES=TRUE  and now returns a named
        result when its input was a character.

    o	plot.stepfun  has new arguments  lty and lwd.

    o   x labels in boxplot now handled differently, so that math
    	expressions are allowed.

    o	postscript() argument `onefile' now does something, and there
	is a new paper type `special' and new argument `pagecentre'.
	See ?postscript for details.

    o	Experimental function dev2bitmap() to copy to a bitmap graphics format.


BUG FIXES

    o	centering in text() will be more accurate, particularly on devices
	with full font metric information (postscript, x11, not windows).

    o	arguments after --no-readline in the Unix version were ignored.

    o	couldn't set attributes in hashed environments.

    o	[<-.data.frame mishandled dfr[1] <- 1 (forgotten drop=FALSE)

    o	sys.on.exit didn't work

    o	sys.parent didn't quite work either for n >= 2.

    o	par("mfg") was wrong, par(mfg=) switched to down columns. Now
	par(mfrow/mfcol = c(nr, nc)) followed by par(mfg=c(i,j)) is
	the preferred style.

    o	plot( <aov.object> ) failed after 2nd plot, PR#279

    o	Several patches for systems with long != int.

    o	approx failed if inputs contained NAs.

    o	weighted lm fits with 1 diml x failed if any weight was zero.

    o	lm.influence failed when there were undetermined coefficients, PR#280.

    o	problem with function()... inside saved functions because arg count
	increased to accommodate stored source. (Incorrect number of
	arguments to "lambda")

    o	improvements to generation of HTML help files: should work
	better on viewers other than Netscape.

    o	stl in package ts could conflict with package leaps: the Fortran
	symbols have been changed.

    o	help page for factor is improved and corrected.

    o	na.omit.ts and na.contiguous now preserve time-series attributes.

    o	more automatic testing ("make check") using options(error.halt=FALSE)
	led to the elimination of dozens (!) of seg.fault possibilities.

    o	family quasi handles zero observations with var=mu^2 more correctly.

    o	dynamically-loaded libraries are searched last-loaded first, as
	documented (under Unix it used to be first-loaded first).

    o	rowsum failed with a matrix and a single group (drop=FALSE needed).

    o	deriv(y ~ <expr>(x)) now works as well as  deriv(~ <expr>(x)).

    o	qr over-estimated ranks in some degenerate cases.
	qr did not work correctly if n < p and the first n cols were
	rank-deficient.

    o	str() wouldn't work quite right for named characters;  doesn't quote
	symbols anymore.

    o	Colour conversion (rgb, gray, hsv) truncated doubles and so
	gave machine-dependent results on the examples. It now rounds.

    o	cat() now admits again that it can't handle lists instead of
	"random" segfaulting.

    o	More accurate rounding (including rounding to even) on platforms
	without rint (e.g. Windows).

    o	qgeom() is now left-continuous with a tolerance, and so the
	example on the help page will be platform-independent.

    o	pretty() has been changed to use tolerance around integers and
	so will be more platform-independent. The exact output has
	probably changed on all platforms for some input.

    o	image() & filled.contour() now work for 1x1 matrices
	and with constant z values.

                      Windows News (since R0.64.2)

rw0651
======

New function savePlot() to save plots to wmf, gif or ps.

There is now support for help via compiled HTML files (as used by the
latest Microsoft products): set options(chmhelp=TRUE) to use this.
You will probably need Internet Explorer 4 or later installed to use
this, or you can install hhupd.exe from the windows/windows-NT/base/etc
directory on CRAN.

There is support for building Windows help files (as in Windows 95).
Set options(winhelp=TRUE) to make this your preferred help system.

Both compiled HTML files and Windows help are available for the
standard packages.

The new function update.packages() is supported if you have wget.exe
(a copy is in the windows/windows-NT/base/etc/wget.zip on CRAN) or
lynx.exe, from http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/lynxport.htm.

On NT only, CPU times are returned by proc.time() (using a call to
GetProcessTimes).

Rotated text on a windows / win.* device is placed more accurately,
especially for non-multiples of 90 degrees.

A windows() device reports itself as `windows' not `X11'.

getenv() now returns all the environmental variables.

unlink() can now remove (empty) directories (but not using wildcard
specifications).

The complex LINPACK routines which were not included in the Unix
versions of R are now omitted here.

There is more support for (support of) ActiveX Automation via the
Rproxy.dll: see the file front-ends/readme.

As under Unix, .Renviron is first searched for in the working directory, 
then in the home directory. (See README for how the home directory is
decided.)

The sockets code is definitely working in this version, enough to support
source.url and friends.

options(pager="console") is set as the default if --ess is used (as it
works better with Emacs).

The rounding code has been re-written to be more accurate and to round
to even as documented.

The rw-FAQ is linked into the HTML help system.

We believe the problems with re-sizing windows (especially on Windows 9x)
have been solved.



rw0650
======

[ Because Guido Masarotto was ill for several weeks, rw0650 was only ever
pre-released. ]

There are many changes `under the skin' which are not reflected in
user-visible changes, but either improve performance or will allow
future enhancements.

The environment variables have been changed: R_HOME is now R's home
directory and R_USER is the HOME for the user which will be used by R
(and defaults to HOME, if set, then to ${HOMEDRIVE}${HOMEPATH}, if that
is set, then the working directory). (There are many other such
changes in R: for example RLIBS becomes R_LIBS, although for the time
being RLIBS is also recognised.)

Saving a plot as postscript from the device menu will produce a
portrait plot irrespective of the setting of ps.options().

Saving a plot as a metafile should be more reliable on machines which
report incorrect information on the size of the screen.

The new flag --no-environ suppresses reading .Renviron and is implied by
--vanilla.

When rterm is used non-interactively either --save or --no-save must be
specified: these is no longer a default of --no-save (for consistency 
with Unix).

More support for building R into other applications: see the examples
in the front-ends directory of the source distribution.

Interrupting by Esc or Ctrl-Break is handled internally by signals, so
the `User Break' response will no longer appear, but in rterm ^C will
be echoed.

There is limited support for `tilde-expansion': file paths such as
~/rest will be expanded to ${HOME}\rest if HOME is set, or to
${HOMEDRIVE}${HOMEPATH}\rest if those variables are set.

Using rterm either interactively or with --ess will be more responsive and
use much less CPU time when waiting for input.  Interruptions by Ctrl-Break
or (under --ess, for use by ESS) Ctrl-C should happen immediately and be 
handled correctly. [On NT: problems with Win 98 were corrected for rw0651.]

The installer can now install correctly in a top-level directory (e.g.
C:\), fixing a bug in the unzip code used.

Hi,

we had a broken heating system (in the floor above us) resulting in a
water burst .... my office looks like if a bomb has exploded ...

Currently our server is up and running again (it was down over the
weekend) ... but we will move out of the devastated rooms and hence
the CARN master might be down one or more times during the rest of the
week. We'll try to keep the down times as short as possible.

Best,
Fritz

Message-ID: <14361.36672.45015.682102@galadriel.ci.tuwien.ac.at>



After moving to new offices we have major troubles with our internet
connection (ping reports packet losses of 50% to any destination
outside our domain) such that our server www.ci.tuwien.ac.at is de
facto unreachable from the rest of the world. Due to a holiday on
Monday this is a ``long weekend'' and all people from the university
computing center stopped working at noon. Their next try to fix the
situation will be on Tuesday.

Sorry for all inconveniences and having to bother you!

Subject: Anonymous cvs access
Message-ID: <6rwvrngryh.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>


With Tony Rossini's help we have established anonymous CVS access to a
read-only copy of the main R CVS tree at cvs.r-project.org.  This
would be of interest primarily to those who want to track the
development version (and who have access to CVS, of course).

To use anonymous cvs you must log in to the server under the name
"anoncvs" and with the password "anoncvs".  You only need to log in
once.  Subsequent updates use a stored version of the password so you
could, for example, use a crontab entry on a Unix or Linux system to
obtain updates automatically.

Currently a checked-out copy of the CVS source tree occupies about 10
MB.  To compile and install the sources requires about 25 MB.

Checking out a copy is done by

$ # Remember the password is "anoncvs" and you only need to do this once
$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at cvs.r-project.org:/home/rcvs/src login
(Logging in to anoncvs at cvs.r-project.org)
CVS password: 
$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at cvs.r-project.org:/home/rcvs/src checkout R
... many pages of filenames follow here

Updating your sources is done by

$ cvs update R

The anonymous CVS repository also contains the modules R-manuals and
R-notes.  You get those by

$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at cvs.r-project.org:/home/rcvs/src checkout R-manuals
etc.

Subject: postgresql package for R
Message-ID: <382CCA91.83F068EF@nceas.ucsb.edu>


A preliminary release of my postgres package for R is at

    http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~keitt/R/postgres.tgz

It allows one to read and write data frames to and from a postgres
database, execute queries and has an experimental "proxy" interface that
allows you to access postgres tables using the standard, local data
frame model.  All accesses to the data frame generate the appropriate
queries and returns the data from the database.  (The proxy interface is
broken at the moment.)  I'm mostly looking for a few testers (hopefully
with postgresql experience) to try it out.

Cheers,
Tim

I've made some small updates to my postgres access package for R.  Its

database name, etc. from within R instead of relying on environment
variables.

It can be downloaded from http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~keitt/R/rpgsql.tgz

(Someone was going to send me an example package make file, but I've
lost their email.  I would be grateful for a copy if someone has some
pre-made make files for R packages.)

Subject: R 0.90.0 is released
Message-ID: <x2g0xy1vvg.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-0.90.0.tgz a moment ago. The jump in version number
indicates that we are approaching version 1.0, more than a "quantum
leap" in functionality.

You can get it from (notice that we have changed servers in Wisconsin
with much better availability and new names)

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-0.90.0.tgz 

or

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-0.90.0.tgz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

There's also a version split in two for floppies if you prefer that.


	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.



Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

        **************************************************


NEW FEATURES

    o   packages splines (for regression smoothing splines or
        interpolating splines) and nls (nonlinear least squares) are
        part of the base distribution.

    o   New error handling using
        options ( error = expression(..) ,  warning.expr = ... ).
        REPLACING version 0.65.1's  options(error.halt = T/F)

    o   collected warnings before an error are no longer lost but
        are printed after the error message (unless the error makes
        this impossible).

    o   A couple of substantial graphics changes, esp. in the X11
        driver. The scaling of symbols is now linear in cex=, rather
        than being tied to the available font's size. The fonts on an
        X11 device also scale linearly with cex= insofar as your X
        server can do it. On systems with the scalable type 1
        PostScript fonts installed, this looks particularly nice. Note
        that the scaling is linear in the *diameter*, but quadratic in
        area. The distance between lines of margin text in the X11
        device is now proportional to the size given to
        x11(pointsize).


    o   abline(a,b) now (again) refers to transformed coordinates on
        plots with log-axes, so that abline(lm(log10(y)~log10(x)))
        (say) draws a best-fitting line on a log-log plot. The earlier
        convention (to draw a curve representing a line in original
        coordinates) is available using a new untf= argument.

    o   barplot.default() has new `axisnames' (and `sub') arguments, easily
        allowing suppression of bar labeling.

    o   cbind() and rbind() now actually do what deparse.level=1 implies:
        add column/row names based on the deparsed argument, provided it
        is a simple symbol. The behaviour is still hardcoded, though.

    o   gc() now reports the total sizes in Mb as well as numbers.

    o   New function help.search() for searching the names, titles,
        aliases, or keywords in the help system.

    o   image() allows x and y to specify either the boundaries or the
        midpoints of the cells. If the latter, the whole cells are
        drawn, rather than the outer cells being half-sized as previously.

    o   NULL extra arguments to model.frame() are now treated as missing
        (instead of an error).

    o   optimization with nlm() can use analytic gradients and Hessians
        if they are supplied.

    o   on.exit() allows add=TRUE.

    o   function parse.dcf() for parsing files in debian control file format
        (DESCRIPTION, CONTENTS, ...)

    o   predict.{g}lm has a type="terms" option, and residual.glm has
        type="partial" as a step towards plot.gam().

    o   New arguments to q() and quit() allow the exit status to be set
        and the execution of .Last() to be skipped.

    o   New function regexpr(), similar to grep but returns the position
        of the match in each string. (For S-PLUS compatibility.)

    o   scan() now supports complex numbers.

    o   New function sort.list, for S compatibility. (This has argument
        partial, but always sorts completely.)

    o   storage.mode<- can be used to set "single", and if setting
        anything other than "single" it removes the "Csingle" attribute.

    o   new function sunflowerplot().

    o   New function undoc() for listing undocumented objects.


    o   User's .Rprofile now executes in global environment

    o   All HTML pages now use the new style sheet doc/html/R.css

    o   html and text files have now a header line giving the name of
        the help file and the package. The description section now
        comes first.

    o   All the standard packages have DESCRIPTION files with
        "Priority: base", so installed.packages and
        package.description will work with them.

    o   The R-external manual which describes programming for the
        .Call and .External interfaces is in the doc/manual directory.

    o   New target `make pdf' in doc/manuals makes hyperlinked PDF 
        documentation. (This is experimental for this release. See
        doc/manual/README for further details.)


    o   S.h now contains (via Rdefines.h) a MESSAGE macro, and
        Free NULLs the pointer, for compatibility with S3 (but not S4).

    o   New subroutine REALPR callable from Fortran (like DBLEPR but
        for real arguments): useful if as.single is in use.

    o   The cex= argument to plot() etc. can be a vector, like pch=.

    o   lty=0 now (again) makes lines invisible. Looks better for
        barplot label axis.

    o   zero.R tries to find the zero DLL in a system-independent way.


BUG FIXES

    o   apply should now work for all un-dimnamed arrays (PR#318).

    o   ar(..., demean=F) works more consistently across methods.

    o   barplot() had lower limits set at -0.01, causing trouble with
        small heights. Switch to relative scale. (Thanks to Matt Wiener)

    o   density() should work better with NAs and infinite values. See
        ?density for the current definitions of how these are handled.

    o   diag(x) now works (as pre 0.65.1) for 1-d arrays.

    o   Stored-source was dropped by dump().

    o   expand.grid returns a data frame even for one arg.

    o   expand.grid(x) now also works for vector arguments x.

    o   factor(list()) or factor(character(0)) *is* now a factor
        with valid levels(.);
        ordered does NOT allow an `ordered' argument anymore
        and is now defined as trivial call to factor.

    o   help page for gc gives correct size of cons cells (20 bytes
        for 32-bit systems, 36 or more for 64-bit systems).

    o   gcinfo reports correct percentages of heap even for vsize > 200M.

    o   gl(6,3,12) and gl(6,3,2) now both work.

    o   Empty lists now deparse correctly.

    o   na.omit.ts and na.contiguous preserve classes.

    o   plot.factor {plot(<factor>)} now obeys axes=FALSE and xaxt="n".

    o   read.table(as.is = TRUE) would leave everything as character.
        Now it correctly tries to convert to numeric.

    o   require() now has the warn.conflicts argument of library().

    o   Fix problems in scan(flush = TRUE).

    o   scan() got confused by trailing whitespace.

    o   split(x,f) now works even when f is a factor with unused levels
        (PR#294).

    o   mosaicplot() has a formula interface and
        NULL instead of NA default args.

    o   stars() has "NULL" instead of "NA" defaults.

    o   str() is quite a bit nicer with factors.

    o   ts.union, cbind.ts, arithmetic on ts objects now allow
        non-integer frequencies.


    o   Switch to <tt> in HTML pages since Linux Netscape mangles
        Courier.

    o   When documentation is "compiled" (build-help), you now get warnings
        for multiple (conflicting) \alias{.} or \name{.}s.

    o   making the reference manual with `make dvi' copes better with
        isolatin1 characters (but not perfectly as these are not in
        standard TeX fonts).

    o   Rd.sty now uses standard LaTeX constructs like \bm for bold
        math and \url for URLs.


    o   Protect R_fopen against NULL filename in Unix.

    o   Math text in outer margins didn't work.

    o   Text clipping now works in the X11 device.

    o   Pixel rows sometimes got doubled in rotated text on the X11 device.

    o   par("yaxt") is now ok.

    o   Problems with realloc on some systems in AllocBuffer.

    o   Problem with formatReal on non-IEEE systems.

    o   demos/dynload/Makefile used macros that gave incorrect build
        on some non-GNU makes.

    o   Windows version copes better with paths with spaces in.

    o   R CMD check had a typo which made the final message fail.

    o   R_EOF redefined as -1, was causing trouble with isxxxx contructions.

Subject: NLME-3.1 package available for R-0.90.0
Message-ID: <6rzow6nng0.fsf@franz.stat.wisc.edu>


With the assistance of Saikat DebRoy we have produced an nlme package
(linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models) for R (see
http://www.r-project.org/ for details about R).  The nlme package for
R requires R-0.90.0, which was released earlier today.

Also released today was NLME 3.2 for S-PLUS.  We will be working on
incorporating the changes from NLME 3.1 to 3.2 into the R version but
we wanted to get the R version out for testing now so we are releasing
it in the 3.1 version.

nlme_3.1-1.tar.gz was just uploaded to the master CRAN (Comprehensive
R Archive Network) site.  It should appear on the archives, like
http://cran.r-project.org/ in a day or two.  For those who are
anxious, the file can be downloaded as
	    http://nlme.stat.wisc.edu/R/nlme_3.1-1.tar.gz

This package incorporates the functions that were previously available
as the lme package for R.  Use the lme package with version 0.65.1 of
R or earlier (although we would recommend that you instead upgrade to
0.90.0 and the nlme package).  Use the nlme package with version
0.90.0 or later.  Do not try to use both.

The graphics in the NLME 3.2 and earlier libraries for S-PLUS use
trellis graphics extensively.  These graphics does not work in R
because trellis is not available for R.

	  rsync -rC rsync.r-project.org::r-release R-0.90.0

The development tree is also available via anonymous rsync as
		     rsync.r-project.org::r-devel

The -C option in the rsync command is to cause it to skip the CVS
directories.

Once you have a copy of the tree, you can keep it up to date with an
rsync command like the above.  Further information on rsync is
available at http://rsync.samba.org/rsync/

Subject: R 0.90.0 for Windows
Message-ID: <19991124103107.48010@hal.stat.unipd.it>


A binary distribution of R 0.90.0 for Windows is available at 
http://cran.r-project.org (in bin/windows/windows-NT/base). 
It should run on  Windows 9X/NT/2000 systems. 

Windows News:
-------------
We made a determined attempt to quote paths which might contain spaces,
and almost all cases work. Be careful with external unzip, pager and editor
programs that these do handle quoted paths.

Rterm can be interrupted by Ctrl-C as well as Ctrl-Break. Fast
typing should not give problems in interactive use.

Better formatting of math expressions in graphics labels, legends, ...
(but only if font is True Type since it seems not possible to get
per-char font metric information for raster fonts).

Support for GIF format bitmaps has been removed, but support for PNG, 
JPEG and BMP has been added. This can be done via the File menu on the
graphics window, savePlot() or dev.print to the new devices png(), bmp() 
and jpeg(), which can also be used directly.

PDF versions of the (draft) manuals are available in file rw0900d.zip
and install into rw0900/doc/manual.  These can be read in Acrobat
Reader from the Manuals sub-menu of the Help menu provided they and
the reader (http://www.adobe.com) are installed.

The installer will install packages in the library directory if the
installation directory path ends in rw0900.

You can install packages by

    install.packages("/path/to/mypkg.zip", CRAN=NULL)

Subject: DSE package for multi-variate time series
Message-ID: <383C083D.BFA4F405@bank-banque-canada.ca>


A new version of my DSE package for multi-variate time series analysis
is
now available at <www.bank-banque-canada.ca/pgilbert>. I am trying to
sort
out some minor glitches with the new R 0.90 graphics before I submit it
to CRAN. Much of the underlying code has been re-worked and reorganized
in the
new version. In particular, the use of model and data constructors has
been
more formalized and the internal structure of these objects, while still

documented, is considered "opaque."

I have separated out a "syskern" package which tries to provide a kernel
of
routines to isolate OS differences and a few Splus and R differences.
For most
people, the most interesting part of this is probably the approach to
RNG,
which provides a convenient way to generate the same random experiments
in R
and Splus.

I have also separated out a "tframe" package which provides a kernel of
routines for programming time series methods. These allow a programmer
to
write most code in a way that is independent of the time representation
(i.e.
the class of the time series data). So, for example, the use of tsp() is
avoided
because it is specific to certain classes of time series.

The changes to the underlying structure necessitated a substantial
re-write of
the user's guide, so I am taking the opportunity to bring the guide
up-to-date
with respect to R. A draft of the guide is available at the above web
site in
postscript and pdf files. The first nine sections, which cover material
in the previous version of the guide, are now mostly complete and I hope

correct. I would certainly appreciate comments. Some later sections,
which
cover new material, are still missing or incomplete.

The help has largely been converted to integrate with R's help. I have
not yet worked through all the examples, many of which were written with
fictitious data in mind, so it will be some time before "R CMD check
dse" works, however, most of my tests work in both Linux and Solaris.
These include:

   random.number.test()
   tframe.function.tests()
   dse1.function.tests()
   dse2.function.tests()
   dse3.function.tests()
   dse4.function.tests()
   guide.example.tests.part1()
   guide.example.tests.part2()

which cover a large part of the package. The comparison tolerances on
some of
the tests had to be relaxed in order to pass with R on Linux and R and
Splus 3.3
in Solaris. I would appreciate feedback about how the tests work on
other
platforms.

Date: Thu, 2 Dec 1999 14:00:57 -0600 (CST)
Subject: rsync.r-project.org has been updated
Message-ID: <m11tcPR-000ZSxC@franz.stat.wisc.edu>


rsync.r-project.org now offers three flavors of the R sources.
 $ rsync rsync.r-project.org::
 r-release      	R sources (feature-frozen version) CVS tree (approx 10 MB)
 r-release-patched	patched R sources (feature-frozen version) CVS tree (approx 10 MB)
 r-devel        	R sources (development version) CVS tree (approx 10 MB)
 xlispstat      	xlispstat sources (development version) CVS tree (approx 12 MB)
 ess            	ess (Emacs Speaks Statistics) CVS tree (approx 8.5 MB)
 omega          	Omega Project for Statistical Computing CVS tree

These three versions correspond to the tar.gz files available in
CRAN as
 r-release         -> CRAN/src/base/R-0.90.0.tgz
 r-release-patched -> CRAN/src/devel/R-release.tar.gz
 r-devel           -> CRAN/src/devel/R-devel.tar.gz
The rsync trees are created directly from the master CVS archive and
are updated hourly.

I believe that the problems with g+s permissions on some of the files
from rsync.r-project.org have been fixed.  Please send me e-mail if
you encounter such problems again.

Fritz just put tseries_0.4-0 on CRAN. New is mainly the non-parametric
bootstrap for time series which should be quite efficient since
resampling is completely done within C.

Comments and suggestions are welcome!

Subject: R-0.90.1 is released 
Message-ID: <x2wvqgbatv.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>



I've rolled up R-0.90.1.tgz a moment ago. 

You can get it from

ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-0.90.1.tgz 

or

http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-0.90.1.tgz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

There's also a version split in two for floppies and a patch file if
you prefer that.

	For the R Core Team,

	Peter D.

Here's the relevant bit of the NEWS file:


                CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.90.1


NEW FEATURES

    o   rect(.) has `lwd' argument.

    o   legend() has a `adj' argument and has been streamlined (and fixed up).

    o   `unname' convenience function [experimental data.frame behavior].

    o   `examples' sections have been added to the documentation
        for most of the data sets in the base library.

    o   update.packages & friends have new argument contriburl for
        incomplete CRAN mirrors. Package bundles such as VR can be
        directly installed both from the shell and from inside R.

    o   RLIBS is no longer accepted as well as R_LIBS (which has been
        the documented form since 0.65.0).

    o   demo(nlm) has examples of using analytical gradients and
        Hessians.

    o   .Platform$OS.type is standardized to be `unix', `mac' or `windows'

    o   setting cex in matplot(matrix(1:25,5), cex=1:5) now works

    o   ar.ols() has separate demean and intercept arguments, uses
        internal scaling for greater accuracy.

    o   xxxPR functions allow NCHAR=-1 for S compatibility.

    o   `Rcomplex' is preferred to `complex' (a future reserved word
        in C) for R complex objects passed to C.

    o   new function dir.create() for platform-independence.

    o   help.search() creates a database for faster searching later in
        the R session.

    o   density() allows for more kernels and has a new argument
        `give.Rkern' to access the relevant kernel property.

    o   multivariate methods for ar: "yule-walker" (now in C) and
        "burg" (new) contributed by Martyn Plummer.

    o   New data sets `HairEyeColor' (hair and eye color of statistics
        students), `Titanic' (survival of passengers on the Titanic),
        and `UCBAdmissions' (student admissions at UC Berkeley).


BUG FIXES

    o   Many help pages have been revised and enhanced.

    o   predict.glm() works again with type="link".

    o   subscripting arrays and matrices no longer loses the names of
        the dimnames vector.  Transpose also preserves the names.

    o   examples in help files containing \testonly are no longer
        (partially) duplicated.

    o   is.numeric() of a factor is now FALSE

    o   prevent a segfault in plotmath

    o   f <- get("function"); f(,); f(F,F)  now "ok" (PR#361).

    o   blank-line reject code in parse.dcf was wrong (Martyn Plummer)

    o   made filled.contour independent of pointsize. Make plot key
        wider so there's room for a title. Touchup example.

    o   font size fixups for the X11 driver (mainly)

    o   some.list[[NA]] is NULL, following S, rather than giving spurious
        error messages

    o   segfault when running out of heap

    o   segfault in rbind of a vector without names fixed. cbind, too.

    o   fixed symbol size problems with PostScript driver

    o   unique() & duplicated() only work for atomic vectors;
        unique(data.frame(""[F])) doesn't segfault anymore.

    o   get("attr<-")(""[0],""[0]) doesn't segfault anymore.

    o   blunder in do_memoryprofile, causing segfault on Alpha machines

    o   erroneous error message in coerceToSymbol

    o   partial workaround for workspace restore problems. This can
        happen if an environment on the search path is assigned to a
        variable which gets saved. The error "unresolved node during
        restore" is turned into a warning, allowing the rest of the
        workspace to be restored, but the variable contains an empty
        environment on reload.

    o   density(x) now works also when IQR(x) == 0.
        density(x, window=...) now works [S compatibility].

    o   prevent points from being plotted if pch, cex, or col are NA.
        Does not apply to bg on pch 21--25 (where NA means
        "transparent") because it would require fixes at the driver
        level.

Windows changes since 0.90.0
----------------------------
It is possible to install packages from any directory (set PKGDIR on
the make command) and to any directory (set RLIB on the make command).

RLIBS is no longer accepted for the library directory: use R_LIBS
(which has been preferred since 0.65.0).

The code to set the `cra' parameter for a windows() device (and hence
the base character size of symbols) is more robust.

The code handling Ctrl-like keys has been changed and ought to be more
robust (AltGr on Danish Windows NT used to misbehave.)

savePlot recognises filename="clipboard" (or "") for wmf plots.

The installer has always been version-specific and now tests it is
being used for the right version.

Subject: DSE revised for R 0.90.1
Message-ID: <385FEE0D.524A7EA7@bank-banque-canada.ca>


A slightly revised version of my DSE package for multi-variate time series
analysis is  now available at <www.bank-banque-canada.ca/pgilbert>.  This
version works with R 0.90.1 (and not with R 90.0 or earlier versions). It can
also be installed with

install.packages(c("syskern", "tframe", "dse"),
 contriburl="http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/pgilbert/dse/R")

A draft version of the new users guide is also available at the web site.
Comments would be appreciated. I will put a version of the libraries on CRAN in
the new year.
