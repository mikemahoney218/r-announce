Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0602231652490.26868@artemis.imbe.med.uni-erlangen.de>


Dear useRs,

The submission deadline for `useR! 2006', the second R user conference to 
be held in Vienna June 15-17 2006, is only five days ahead. So this 
weekend is the perfect time to submit abstracts for user-contributed 
sessions!

The sessions will be a platform to bring together R users, contributers,
package maintainers and developers in the S spirit that `users are 
developers'.

We invite all R users to submit abstracts on topics presenting innovations 
or exciting applications of R. A web page offering more information on the 
`useR!' conference, abstract submission, registration and Vienna is 
available at

   http://www.R-project.org/useR-2006/

We look forward to receiving your abstract!

Vienna (1999, 2001, 2003) and the "Directions in Statistical Computing" 
conference in Seattle last year ...

DSC 2007, a conference on systems and environments for statistical 
computing, will take place in Auckland, New Zealand on February 15 & 16, 
2007.

This is just an announcement of date and location so that interested 
parties living on the far side of the planet have time to book their 
travel;  further details and a web site for the conference will be 
announced in due course.

Subject: R 2.3.0 is released 
Message-ID: <x2psj71a5m.fsf@viggo.kubism.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.3.0.tar.gz a short while ago. This version contains
several changes and additions, mostly incremental. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it (in a short while) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.3.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.
 
There is also a version split for floppies.

Here is the relevant bit of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.3.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	In the grid package there are new 'arrow' arguments to
	grid.line.to(), grid.lines(), and grid.segments()
	(grid.arrows() has been deprecated).

	The new 'arrow' arguments have been added BEFORE
	the 'name', 'gp' and 'vp' arguments so existing code that
	specifies any of these arguments *by position* (not by name)
	will fail.

    o	all.equal() is more stringent, see the PR#8191 bug fix below.

    o	The data frame argument to transform() is no longer called 'x',
	but '_data'.  Since this is an invalid name, it is less likely
	to clash with names given to transformed variables. (People
	were getting into trouble with transform(data, x=y+z).)


NEW FEATURES

    o	arima.sim() has a new argument 'start.innov' for compatibility
	with S-PLUS.  (If not supplied, the output is unchanged from
	previous versions in R.)

    o	arrows() has been changed to be more similar to segments():
	for example col=NA omits the arrow rather than as previously
	(undocumented) using par("col").

    o	as.list() now accepts symbols (as given by as.symbol() aka
	as.name()).

    o	atan2() now allows one complex and one numeric argument.

    o	The 'masked' warnings given by attach() and library() now only
	warn for functions masking functions or non-functions masking
	non-functions.

    o	New function Axis(), a generic version of axis(), with Date and
	POSIX[cl]t methods.  This is used by most of the standard
	plotting functions (boxplot, contour, coplot, filled.contour,
	pairs, plot.default, rug, stripchart) which will thus label x
	or y axes appropriately.

    o	pbeta() now uses TOMS708 in all cases and so is more accurate
	in some (e.g. when lower.tail = FALSE and when one of the
	shape parameters is very small).

    o	[qr]beta(), [qr]f() and [qr]t() now have a non-centrality parameter.

    o	[rc]bind and some more cases of subassignment are implemented
	for raw matrices.  (PR8529 and 8530)

    o	The number of lines of deparsed calls printed by browser() and
	traceback() can be limited by the option "deparse.max.lines".
	(Wish of PR#8638.)

    o	New canCoerce() utility function in "methods" package.

    o	[pq]chisq() are considerably more accurate for moderate (up to
	80) values of ncp, and lower.tail = FALSE is fully supported
	in that region.  (They are somewhat slower than before.)

    o	chol(pivot = TRUE) now gives a warning if used on a (numerically)
	non-positive-definite matrix.

    o	chooseCRANmirror() consults the CRAN master (if accessible) to
	find an up-to-date list of mirrors.

    o	cov.wt() is more efficient for 'cor = TRUE' and has a new 'method'
	argument which allows 'Maximum Likelihood'.

    o	do.call() gains an 'envir' argument.

    o	eigen() applied to an asymmetric real matrix now uses a
	tolerance to decide if the result is complex (rather than
	expecting the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues to be exactly
	zero).

    o	New function embedFonts() for embedding fonts in PDF or
	PostScript graphics files.

    o	fisher.test() now uses p-values computed via hypergeometric
	distributions for all 2 by 2 tables.  This might be slightly
	slower for a few cases, but works much better for tables with
	some large counts.

	There is a new option to simulate the p-value for larger than
	2 x 2 tables.

    o	for() now supports raw vectors as the set of indices.

    o	getNativeSymbolInfo() is vectorized for the 'name' argument.  It
	returns a named list of NativeSymbolInfo objects, but is
	backward compatible by default when called with a character
	vector of length 1, returning the NativeSymbolInfo object.

    o	help.search() no longer attempts to handle packages installed
	prior to R 2.0.0, and reports the current path to the
	package (rather than where it was originally installed: this
	information is not shown by the print() method).

    o	Added "hexmode" to parallel "octmode".

    o	install.packages() now does tilde expansion on file paths
	supplied as 'pkgs'.

    o	install.packages() has additional arguments 'configure.args' and
	'clean' which allow the caller to provide additional arguments
	to the underlying R CMD INSTALL shell command when installing
	source packages on a Unix-alike.

    o	is.loaded() has a new argument 'type' to confine the search to
	symbols for .C, .Fortran, .Call or .External: by default it
	looks for a symbol which will match any of them.  It is now
	internal and not primitive, so argument matching works in the
	usual way.

    o	The symmetry test for matrices used in eigen() has been ``exported''
	as the 'matrix' method of a new S3-generic 'isSymmetric().

    o	.leap.seconds and the internal adjustment code now know about
	the 23rd leap second on 2005-12-31: the internal code uses a
	run-time test to see if the OS does.

    o	The 'col' argument of legend() now defaults to par("col")
	(which defaults to "black", the previous default), so that
	the lines/symbols are shown in the legend in the colour that
	is used on the plot.

    o	log2() and log10() call C functions of the same name if
	available, and will then be more likely to be precise to
	machine accuracy.

    o	new.packages() gains a ... argument to pass e.g. 'destdir' to
	install.packages().  (Wish of PR#8239.)

    o	nls() now supports 'weights'.

    o	The vector passed as the first argument of the 'fn' and 'gr'
	arguments of optim() has the names (if any) given to argument
	'par'.

    o	options(expressions) is temporarily increased by 500 during
	error-handling.	  This enables e.g. traceback() to work when
	the error is reaching the limit on the nesting of expressions.

    o	page() accepts general R objects, not just names (and
	previously undocumented) character strings.  This allows the
	object to be specified as a call, for example.  More options
	are allowed in its '...' argument.

    o	pairs() allows a wider class of inputs, including data frames
	with date and date-time columns.

    o	par() and the in-line use of graphical parameters produce more
	informative error messages, distinguishing between
	non-existent pars and inappropriate use of valid pars.

	Graphical parameters 'family', 'lend', 'ljoin' and 'lmitre'
	can now be set in-line.

	There is no longer a warning if non-settable pars are used
	in-line, but there is an appropriate warning if unknown pars
	are passed.

	The length limit for the 'family' parameter has been increased
	to 200 bytes, to allow for the names of some CID-keyed fonts
	in multi-byte locales.

    o	The pdf() device now allows 'family' to be specified in the same
	generality as postscript().

    o	The pdf() device writes /FontDescriptor entries for all fonts
	except the base 14, and does not write font entries for unused
	fonts.

    o	Plotmath allows 'vartheta', 'varphi' and 'varsigma' (or 'stigma')
	as synonyms for 'theta1', 'phi1' and 'sigma1', and the help
	page has a note for TeX users.

    o	plot.xy() now takes its default arguments from the
	corresponding par() settings, so points(type="l") and
	lines(type="p") behave in the same way (and more obviously,
	also for type="b").

    o	poly() has a new argument 'raw', mainly for pedagogical purposes.

    o	The class "POSIXlt" now supports fractional seconds (as
	"POSIXct" has always done).  The printing of fractional seconds
	is controlled by the new option "digits.secs", and by default is off.

    o	postscript() supports family = "ComputerModernItalic" for
	Computer Modern with italic (rather than slanted) faces.

    o	The postscript()/pdf() font metrics for the 14 standard fonts
	(only, not the rest of the common 35) have been updated to
	versions from late 1999 which cover more glyphs.  There are
	also a few differences in the metrics and hence the output
	might be slightly different in some cases.

    o	The way families can be specified for postscript() and pdf()
	has been expanded to include CID-keyed fonts, with new
	functions Type1Font() and CIDFont() to set up such fonts
	families.

    o	prettyNum() has new arguments 'preserve.width' and 'zero.print'.
	When the former is not "none", as in calls from format() and
	formatC(), the resulting strings are kept at the desired width
	when possible even after adding of 'big.mark' or 'small.mark'.

    o	proc.time() and system.time() now record times to 1ms accuracy
	where available (most Unix-like systems).

    o	The initialization methods for the quasi() family have been
	changed to depend on the variance function, and in particular
	to work better for the "mu(1-mu)" variance function.  (PR#8486)

    o	read.table() gains a 'flush' argument passed to scan().

    o	require() now takes a 'lib.loc' argument.

    o	The second argument 'size' to sample() is required to have
	length 1, so that errors when supplying arguments are more
	easily detected.

    o	The default is now compress = !ascii in save() (but not save.image).

    o	scan() and write.table() now have some interruptibility, which
	may be useful when processing very large files.

    o	A new heuristic test, seemsS4Object() is supplied, along with a
	similar C-level test, R_seemsS4Object(object). The test
	detects probable S4 objects by their class's attribute. See
	the help page.

    o	S3 classes can now be made non-virtual S4 classes by supplying a
	prototype object in the arguments to setOldClass().

    o	splinefun() returns a function that now also has a 'deriv' argument
	and can provide up to the 3rd derivative of the interpolating
	spline, thanks to Berwin Turlach.
	
    o	stopifnot(A) now gives a better error message when A has NAs, and
	uses "not all TRUE" when A has length >= 2.

    o	str()'s default method has a new argument 'strict.width' which can
	be used to produce strict 'width' conforming output.  A new
	options(str = list(strict.width = *)) setting allows to control
	this for a whole session.

    o	summary.nls() has a new argument 'correlation' that defaults
	to FALSE (like summary.lm).

    o	Sys.sleep() has sub-millisecond resolution on Unix-alikes
	with gettimeofday().

    o	Sys.time() now has sub-millisecond accuracy on systems
	supporting the POSIX call gettimeofday, and clock-tick
	accuracy on Windows.

    o	The new function timestamp() adds a time stamp to the saved
	command history on consoles which support it.

    o	New function tcrossprod() for efficiently computing x %*% t(x)
	and x %*% t(y).

    o	The suffix used by tempfile() is now in hex on all platforms
	and guaranteed to be at least 6 hex digits (usually 8).

    o	trace() now works more consistently and more like its
	documentation, in particular the assertions about old tracing
	being removed for new.	For debugging purposes (of R) a
	mechanism for debugging the trace computations themselves was
	added.	See trace.R.

    o	The implementation of trace() has beem made more general by
	calling a function to do the trace interaction, and recover()
	now detects trace calls to trim the irrelevant code underneath.

    o	unserialize() can now also read a byte stream from a raw vector.

    o	The useDynLib() directive in the NAMESPACE file now accepts the
	names of the native/foreign symbols that are to be resolved in
	the DLL for use in .C/.Call/.Fortran/.External calls.  These
	can be used as regular R variables instead of the (routine
	name, PACKAGE) pairs currently recommended.  Alternative names
	can be given for the R variables mapping to these symbols.
	The native routine registration information can also be used
	directly via useDynLib(name, .registration = TRUE).  See the
	'Writing R Extensions' manual for more details.

	checkFF() (package 'tools') has been updated accordingly.

    o	validObject() has an option complete=TRUE that recursively
	checks the objects in the slots.  Not used when new(...)
	checks validity.

    o	New Vectorize() function, a wrapper for mapply().

    o	write.ftable() has gained an argument 'append = FALSE' (thanks to
	Stephen Weigand).

    o	On Unix-alikes, X11() now has arguments to request the initial
	position of the window, and 'gamma' defaults to the value of
	getOptions("gamma").  These changes are consistent with the
	windows() device.

    o	X11() and the Unix-alike data entry window can have properties
	(including geometry) set by X resources: see their help files.

    o	xy.coords() & xyz.coords() now have NULL defaults for their 'y' or
	'y' and 'z' arguments.	This is more consistent with their earlier
	documentation, and may be convenient for using them.


    o	Non-syntactic names of list elements are now printed quoted by
	backticks rather than double quotes.

    o	There is some basic checking for imminent C stack overflow (when
	the evaluation depth and the user interrupts are checked).
	On systems with suitable OS support (not Windows), segfaults
	from C stack overflow are caught and treated as an R error.

	New function Cstack_info() reports on stack size and usage.

    	options(expressions) reverts to the default of 5000 now
	stack checking is in place.

    o	Package tcltk does not try to initialize Tk on Unix-alikes
	unless a DISPLAY variable is present.  This allows packages
	dependent on tcltk to be installed without access to an X server.

    o	The code used to guess timezone offsets where not supplied by
	the OS uses a different algorithm that is more likely to guess
	the summer-time transitions correctly.

    o	Package tools contains translation tables 'Adobe_glyphs' and
	'charset_to_Unicode'.

    o	Changed the environment tree to be rooted in an empty
	environment, available as emptyenv().  baseenv() has been
	modified to return an environment with emptyenv() as parent,
	rather than NULL.

    o	gettext has been updated to 0.14.5.

    o	PCRE has been updated to version 6.4.

    o	The method $.DLLInfo resolves the specified symbol in the DLL,
	returning a NativeSymbolInfo object.  Use [[ to access the actual
	values in the DLLInfo object.

    o	On systems with either vasprintf or both va_copy and a vsnprintf
	which reports the size of buffer required, connections such as
	gzfile() and bzfile() can now write arbitrarily long lines,
	not just 100000 chars.

    o	The R session temporary directory is now set in C code using
	the same algorithm whether or not the shell front-end is used
	and on all platforms.  This looks at environment variables
	TMPDIR, TMP and TEMP in turn, and checks if they point to a
	writable directory.

    o	Some of the classical tests put unnecessary restrictions on the
	LHS in the formula interface (e.g., t.test(x+y ~ g) was not
	allowed).

    o	On suitably equipped Unix-alike systems, segfaults, illegal
	operations and bus errors are caught and there is a simple
	error-handler which gives the user some choice as to what to
	do in interactive use. [Experimental.]

	On Windows access violations and illegal instructions are
	caught with a simple error handler.  [Experimental.]

    o	Tracebacks now include calls such as .C/.Fortran/.Call, which
	will help if errors occur in R code evaluated by compiled code
	and in tracebacks presented by the segfault etc handlers.

    o	Treatment of signature objects and method definition objects has
	been modified to give cleaner printing and more consistency in
	the treatment of signatures.  A sometimes useful utility,
	methodSignatureMatrix(), is now exported.

    o	R refrains from printing a final EOL upon exiting the main loop
	if the quiet flag is on and if the save action is known (e.g. this
	is true for --slave).


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The deprecated and undocumented use of atan() with two arguments
	has been removed: instead use atan2().

    o	write.table0() is defunct in favour of write.table().

    o	format.char() is defunct in favour of format.default().

    o	Support for the long-deprecated (and no longer documented)
	arguments --min-vsize --min-nsize --max-vsize --max-nsize
	--vsize --nsize of R CMD BATCH has been removed.

    o	The 'debian' subdirectory has been removed from the sources.

    o	The 'vfont' argument of axis() and mtext() has been removed:
	use par(family=) instead.

    o	The unused graphical parameter "type" has been removed: it
	invited confusion with the 'type' argument to default methods
	of plot(), points() and lines().

    o	nlsMethod() and profiler() are no longer exported from the stats
	namespace (and nlsMethod.plinear() is no longer registered as
	a method, as nlsMethod() was not generic).

    o	The re-named tcltk functions tkcmd, tkfile.tail, tkfile.dir,
	tkopen, tkclose, tkputs, tkread are now formally deprecated.

    o	Argument 'col' of bxp() is now formally deprecated.

    o	Use of NULL as an environment is deprecated and gives a warning.

    o	postscriptFont() is deprecated in favour of Type1Font() (which
	is just a change of name).

    o	La.chol() and La.chol2inv() are deprecated (they have since R
	1.7.0 been the same as the default options of chol() and chol2inv).

    o	La.svd(method = "dgesvd") is deprecated.

    o	The use of install.R and R_PROFILE.R files in packages is
	deprecated: use the DESCRIPTION file instead to arrange to
	save an image or to load dependent packages.

	The following command-line options to INSTALL are deprecated
	(use the fields in the DESCRIPTION file instead):
	-s --save --no-save --lazy --no-lazy --lazy-data --no-lazy-data

    o	Graphical parameter 'tmag' (which is long unused) is deprecated.


INTERNATIONALIZATION

	A set of patches supplied by Ei-ji Nakama has been incorporated.

    o	New postscript encodings for CP1253, CP1257 and Greek (ISO 8859-7).

    o	Support for East Asian CID-keyed fonts in pdf() and postscript().
	Although these usually contain Latin characters no accurate
	AFMs are available and so CID-keyed fonts are intended only
	for use with CJK characters.

    o	Wide-character width functions wc[s]width are provided that
	overcome problems found with OS-supplied ones (and those
	previously used by R on Windows).  This means that
	double-width CJK characters are now supported on all
	platforms.  It seems that the width of some characters (and
	not just CJK characters) depends on which CJK locale's fonts
	are in use and also on the OS.

	Revised wide-character classification functions are
	provided for use on Windows, AIX and MacOS X to replace
	deficient OS-supplied ones.

   o	There is support for MBCS charsets in the pictex() graphics
	device, and rotated (by 90 degrees) text may work better.

   o	The \u (and \U except on Windows) notation for characters which
	is supported by the parser in all MBCS charsets is now always
	interpreted as a Unicode point, even on platforms which do not
	encode wchar_t in Unicode.  These are now a syntax error in
	single-byte locales.

    o	The default encoding for postscript() and pdf() is chosen to
	be suitable for the current locale, if that is a single-byte
	locale which is supported.  This covers European (including
	Greek) and Cyrillic languages.

	In UTF-8 locales, a suitable single-byte encoding is chosen
	for postscript() and pdf(), and text translated to it.

    o	xfig() gains an 'encoding' argument.

    o	There are some message translations into Spanish.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	The encoding files for pdf()/postscript() have been moved to
	directory 'enc' in package 'grDevices'.

    o	Support for MBCS is only enabled if iconv is found and it
	supports enough conversions.  (libiconv does.)

    o	In an MBCS locale, make check now translates the graphics
	examples from Latin-1.	This ensures that they will work
	correctly in UTF-8: it is possible that in other MBCS locales
	they will now fail (rather than work completely incorrectly).

    o	There is a new test, 'test-Docs', which as part of 'make
	check-devel' tests the code in the documentation.  Currently
	it runs doc/manual/R-{exts,intro}.R and the compiled code in
	R-exts.c.

    o	The workaround to allow an external LAPACK-containing BLAS
	such as libsunperf to be used with the internal LAPACK has
	been removed.  If you have such a library you may now need
	to use --with-lapack.  It is no longer possible to use some
	older versions of libsunperf, e.g. Forte 7 on 64-bit builds.

    o	A substitute for mkdtemp is provided, so it is now always
	used for R_TempDir.

    o	Most of the functions checked for by 'configure' also have
	declarations checked for in the appropriate header.

    o	The top-level documentation files AUTHORS COPYING.LIB COPYRIGHTS
	FAQ RESOURCES THANKS have been moved to doc, and COPYING and NEWS
	are installed there.  The file Y2K has been removed from the
	distribution.

    o	The extension .lo is no longer used in building R (only in
	the optional build of libRmath.so): this allows a considerable
	simplification of the Makefiles.

    o	Direct support for f2c has been removed: it can still be used
	via a script which makes it look like a Fortran compiler.
	(src/scripts/f77_f2c is an example of such a script.)

    o	There is a new flag SAFE_FFLAGS which is used for the
	compilation of dlamc.f.	 It is set by configure for known
	problem cases (recent g77 and gfortran), but can be overridden
	by the user.

    o	The standard autoconf macros for large-file support are now used,
	and these are enabled unless --disable-largefile is specified.
	This replaces --enable-linux-lfs (and is now selected by default).

    o	Visibility attributes are used where supported (gcc4/gfortran on
	some platforms, also gcc3/g77 on FC3 and partially elsewhere).
	The main benefit should be faster loading (and perhaps better
	optimized code) in some of the dynamic shared objects (e.g.
	libR.so and stats.so).

    o	The *PICFLAGS are taken to be -fpic rather than -fPIC where
	possible.   This will make no difference on most platforms:
	-fPIC is needed on Sparc (and still used there), but -fpic
	should give slightly better performance on PowerPC (although
	-fPIC is used on PPC64 as it is needed to build libR.so there).

    o	More use is made of inlining for small utility functions such
	as isReal.  Because this can only be done portably with C99
	constructs (and we know of no actual implementation), this is
	only done for the GNU C compiler.

    o	There is an experimental feature to allow shared installations
	of sub-architectures.  See the R-admin manual.

    o	All platforms now use R's internal implementation of strptime,
	which allows fractional seconds.  (The major platforms were
	already using it.)

    o	The dlcompat work-around for old Mac OS X systems (<= 10.2)
	has been removed.  External dlcompat must be installed if needed.


UTILITIES

    o	R CMD check now uses an install log by default.

    o	R CMD check works for packages whose package name is different
	from the directory name in which it is located.

    o	R CMD INSTALL now uses more randomness in the temporary
	directory name even on systems without mktemp -d.

    o	R CMD f77 has been removed now f2c is no longer supported.

    o	The version string shown in the startup message and by
	"R --version", and that stored in variable R.version.string
	are now in exactly the same format.

    o	The base name of a help file needs to be valid as part of a file://
	URL, so R CMD check now checks the names are ASCII and do not
	contain % .

    o	R CMD check now warns about unknown sections in Rd files, and
	invalid names for help, demo and R files, as well as unlikely
	file names in the 'src' directory.  The latter is controlled
	by option --check-subdirs and by default is done if checking a
	tarball without a configure script.

	R CMD build excludes invalid files in the 'man', 'R' and 'demo'
	subdirectories.

    o	\usepackage[noae]{Sweave} in the header of an Sweave file
	supresses auto-usage of the ae package ("almost European"
	fonts) and T1 input encoding.


DOCUMENTATION

    o	Rd format now allows \var{} markup inside \code{} and \examples{}.

    o	Markup such as --, ---, < and > is handled better when
	converting .Rd files to [C]HTML.

    o	There is new markup \link[=dest]{name} to generate a link to topic
	'dest' which is shown as 'name', and \linkS4class{abc} which
	expands to \link[=abc-class]{abc}, for cross-referencing the
	recommended form of documentation for S4 classes.


PACKAGE INSTALLATION

    o	There is now some support for Fortran 90/95 code in packages:
	see `Writing R Extensions'.

    o	Installation of man sources and demos is now done by R code.
	The restrictions on the names of help files, R files and
	of demos are now enforced (see `Writing R Extensions').

    o	Packages which contain compiled code can now have more than
	one dot in their name even on Windows.

    o	The Meta/hsearch.rds database saved now contains LibPath="".
	This information is now always recreated when help.search() is
	run, but the field is retained for back-compatibility.

    o	update.packages() now has a '...' argument to be passed to
	install.packages(), including the formerly separate arguments
	'destdir' and 'installWithVers'.

    o	Make macros AR and RANLIB are now declared in etc/Makeconf for
	use by packages which wish to make static libraries.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	qgamma and rgamma in Rmath.h now check for non-positive arguments.

    o	The BLAS which ships with R now contains the complete set of
	double-complex BLAS routines, rather than just those used in R.

	<R_ext/BLAS.h> has been corrected to add the missing
	double-precision BLAS functions drotmg and drotm, and to
	exclude lsame (which is a Lapack auxiliary function and is now
	declared in <R_ext/Lapack.h>).	It also includes the double
	complex routines added for this release of R provided Fortran
	doublecomplex is usable on the platform.

    o	<R_ext/BLAS.h> and <R_ext/Lapack.h> now declare all the entry
	points as 'extern'.

    o	The flag SAFE_FFLAGS is made available to packages via
	etc/Makeconf and R CMD config.	It can be used where
	optimization needs to be defeated, e.g. in LAPACK setup.

    o	getNativeSymbolInfo has a withRegistrationInfo argument which
	causes the address field to be a reference to the registration
	information if it is available for that symbol.	 If the
	registration information is not available, the address is a
	reference to the native symbol. The default is FALSE which is
	backward compatible, returning just the address of the symbol
	and ignoring registration information.

    o	errorcall and warningcall are now declared in <Rinternals.h>
	(they might be needed in front-ends).

    o	R_FlushConsole and R_ProcessEvents are now declared in <R.h>.

    o	The R_Sock* functions supporting socket connections are no
	longer declared in R-ftp-http.h as they are not loaded into R
	itself, and are now hidden in the module's DLL on suitable systems.


BUG FIXES

    o	Quoted arguments to the R script after --args are now
	passed quoted to the R executable and so will be shown as
	expected by commandArgs().  (They were previously split at
	whitespace even inside quotes on Unix-alikes but not on
	Windows.)

    o	axis() now supports pars 'xaxp'/'yaxp' as inline arguments.

    o	sort() now does not return inappropriate attributes such as
	"dim" and "tsp": it only returns names.

	sort(x, partial=) no longer returns unsorted names, and drops
	names (since it is supplied for efficiency).

    o	Use of non-central F in pf() gives accurate values for larger ncp.

    o	R CMD build --binary does a better job of cleaning up after
	failure to re-make vignettes.

    o	reg-test-1.R tested system(intern=TRUE) which depends on popen
	and so is not supported on all platforms.

    o	Changed apparent mis-spelling of "Gibraltar" in dataset 'eurodist'.

    o	sysconf() is now used to find the number of clock ticks/second:
	under some circumstances glibc reported CLK_TCK = 60 when the
	true value was 100.

    o	identical() was not allowing for embedded nuls in character
	strings. (NB: the comparison operators including == do not,
	and never will.)

    o	The profile() and profiler() methods for "nls" objects now
	support algorithm = "plinear" and algorithm = "port".

    o	The signal handlers for signals USR1 and USR2 where not
	restored if the signal arrived when interrupts were suspended.

    o	Certain combinations of S4 inheritance could cause inherited
	methods to override some directly specified methods.

    o	Some cases of named signatures in calls to setMethod() caused errors.

    o	all.equal() is now more consistent and "picky" about mismatching
	attributes, in particular names(); this is a part of the
	propositions by Andy Piskorkski (PR#8191).

    o	load() when applied to a connection leaves it open/not as it
	found it, and checks explicitly for having a binary readable
	connection.

    o	The p-values given by stat.anova() (called from several
	anova() methods) are now NA (rather than spurious) if
	non-nested models give rise to changes in deviance with a
	different sign from changes in degrees of freedom.

    o	Built-ins were reported as the relevant call in C-level error()s
	iff R profiling was in progress.  Now they are never reported.

    o	Too-long signatures (with no names) were not being caught
	in setMethod().

    o	Slot names in prototype() are being more thoroughly checked.

    o	signif() is more likely to follow the 'round to even' rule for
	exactly representable numbers, e.g. signif(0.25, 1).  (Related
	to PR#8452.)

    o	nls() now works correctly with some low-dimensional fits,
	e.g. with one or zero non-linear parameters.

    o	glm() could give an inappropriate error message if all
	possible coefficients were invalid (e.g. a log-linear binomial
	model with no intercept and a not all positive predictor).

    o	solve() gives clearer error messages for some incorrect usages.
	(PR#8494 and similar)

    o	The gaussian() family was missing the 'valideta' component
	(which could be needed for the "inverse" link function).

	The starting values supplied by the gaussian family could be
	invalid for the "log" and "inverse" link functions.  This is
	now reported.

    o	data.matrix() did not work correctly on zero-row data frames.
	(PR#8496 and other problems.)

    o	The DSC comments in the files from postscript(onefile=FALSE) now
	label all files as having page 1 of 1, as some other software
	seems to expect that.

    o	The axis labels chosen for logarithmic axis are now less
	likely to be linear and inappropriate (when the range is more
	than 10 and less than 100).  (PR#1235)

    o	Staircase lines (types "s" and "S") are now drawn
	continuously rather than a point at a time and so line types,
	mitring and so on work. (PR#2630)

    o	Calling par(mfg) before doing any plotting resulted in NewPage
	never being called on the device, which in turn resulted in
	incorrect output for postcript() and pdf() devices.  (Reported
	by Marc Schwartz in discussion of the non-bug PR#7820.)

    o	terms.formula needed to add parentheses to formulae with
	terms containing '|'.  (PR#8462)

    o	pbirthday() and qbirthday() now also work for very improbable
	events {those you are typically *not* interested in}.

    o	Only source help files starting with an upper- or lower-case
	letter or digit and extension .Rd or .rd are documented to be
	processed.  This is more liberal in that starting with a digit
	is now also allowed, but rule is now enforced.

    o	nls(algorthm="port") was always taking positive numeric
	differences and so could exceed the upper bounds.

    o	methods:::.asEnvironmentPackage() was not allowing for
	versioned installs.

    o	.find.package() now reports which package(s) it cannot find in
	the case it stops with an error.

    o	The standard Unix-alike version of file.show() gives an
	informative message if it cannot open a file rather than the
	(possibly incorrect) 'NO FILE'.

    o	window() did not allow non-overlapping ranges with
	extend = TRUE.	(PR#8545)

    o	pbinom(size = 0) now returns correct values (not NaN).	(PR#8560)

    o	[dp]binom(x, *) for x < 0 now always returns 0. (PR#8700)
	analogous change in pgeom(), pnbinom() and ppois().

    o	[dqpr]geom and [dpqr]nbinom() now all consistently accept prob = 1
	but not prob = 0.  qgeom(prob=1) now gives the correct values
	(not -1).

    o	INSTALL on Unix-alikes was not loading dependent packages when
	preparing for lazy-loading.

    o	qcauchy(1) now gives +Inf instead of just a very large number.

    o	df(0, f1, *) now properly returns Inf, 1, or 0 for f1 < , = , or > 2.

    o	qbinom(), qnbinom() and qpois() now use a better search and
	normally reach the answer very quickly when it is large
	(instead of being slow or infinite-looping).

    o	pt(x, df) lost accuracy in the far tails (when |x| > 1e154) for
	small df (like df = 0.001 for which such extremes are not unlikely).

    o	dbeta(x, a, b) underflowed internally and incorrectly gave 0
	for very small x and a.

    o	None of the warnings about convergence failures or loss of
	precision in nmath (distribution and special functions) were
	being reported to the R user.

    o	dnt was missing from standalone nmath (under Unix-alikes).

    o	split() now accepts factors with numeric (but not storage mode
	integer) codes.

    o	The utilities such as 'check' now report active version numbers
	again, as SVN 'last changed revision' numbers.

    o	addmargins() did not accept a name for 'FUN', only an expression.

    o	'+' for POSIXt objects now takes the tzone from whichever
	object has it, so date+x is the same as x+date if x is numeric.

    o	mean.default() and var() compute means with an additional pass
	and so are often more accurate, e.g. the variance of a
	constant vector is (almost) always zero and the mean of such a
	vector will be equal to the constant value to machine
	precision.  (PR#1228)

	sum(), prod(), mean(), rowSums() and friends use a long double
	accumulator where available and so may be more accurate.  (This
	is particularly helpful on systems such as Sparc and AMD64
	where long double gives considerably greater exponent range
	and precision than double.)

    o	read.dcf() now gives a warning on malformed lines.

    o	add1.[g]lm now try harder to use the environment of the
	formula in the orginal fit to look for objects such as the
	'data' and 'subset' arguments.

    o	gaussian()$aic was inconsistent with e.g. the lm results from
	AIC() and extractAIC() for weighted fits: it treated the weights
	as case weights and not variance factors.

    o	system() on Unix-alikes ignored non-logical values of 'intern' and
	treated 'intern = NA' as true.

    o	as.table() now produces non-NA rownames when converting a
	matrix of more than 26 rows.  (PR#8652)

    o	Partial sorting used an algorithm that was intended only for a
	few values of 'partial' and so could be far slower than a full
	sort.  It now switches to a barebones full sort for more than
	10 values of 'partial' and uses a more efficient recursive
	implementation for 2...10.

    o	summary.glm() returned an estimate of dispersion of Inf for a
	gaussian glm with zero residual degrees of freedom and then
	treated that as a known value.	It now uses the estimate NaN,
	which is consistent with summary.lm().

    o	Sys.sleep() on Unix-alikes was restricted to about 2147 seconds
	and otherwise might never have returned.  (PR#8678)

    o	is(obj, Cl) could wrongly report TRUE when Cl was a classUnion and
	multiple inheritance was involved.

    o	confint[.lm / .default] used label "100 %" for level = 0.999

    o	Empty entries (i.e., extraneous ",") in NAMESPACE files now give
	a better error message early at parsing time instead of a less
	comprehensible one later at load time.

    o	all.equal(n1, n2) could erroneously return NA when n1, n2
	contained large integers.

    o	anova.mlm() didn't handle multi-df effects properly in the
	single-model case (PR#8679)

    o	anova.mlm() had its colnames mangled by data.frame() (needed
	check.names=FALSE).

    o	summary.glm() gave an NA estimate of dispersion for fits with
	zero weights.  (PR#8720)

    o	qhyper() had too small a tolerance for right-continuity on
	some platforms so was not always an inverse to phyper().

    o	rownames<-.data.frame() and dimnames<-.data.frame() tested the
	length(s) of the replacement value(s) before coercion, which
	can change the length (e.g. for class "POSIXlt").

    o	max() and min() ignored the largest/smallest representable
	integer, as well as Inf/-Inf.  (PR#8731)

    o	write.table() assumed factors had integer codes: it now allows
	malformed factors with numeric codes (and otherwise throws an
	error).

    o	Worked around a Solaris restriction which meant that
	Sys.sleep() was only effective for times of up to one second.

    o   sink(, split=TRUE) now works correctly, but is allowed only on
        platforms that support va_copy or __va_copy.  (PR#8716)

    o	factanal(), prcomp() and princomp() now only check that columns
	in the model frame that will be used are numeric (they
	previously also checked columns which were part of negative terms
	in the formula).

    o   Misuse of $ in apply could corrupt memory.  (PR#8718)

    o	apply() could fail if the function returned NULL (e.g. if
	there was a single row).

    o	registerS3method() failed due to a typo. (It was almost never
	used.)

    o	Registering an S3 method for an S3 generic in another package
	that was converted to an S4 generic in the same package as the
	S3 method, registered the method in the wrong place.

    o	Recall() used lookup for the function in use and so could fail
	if that was an S3 method not on the search path.

    o	Rdconv -t Ssgm failed if it encountered \link[opt]{arg}.

    o	uniroot() did not give a warning (as documented) if it failed
	to converge in 'maxiter' steps.  (PR#8751)

    o	eapply (and as.list.environment) did not work for the base
	environment/namespace.  (PR#8761)

    o	Added protection in configure against systems for which using
	xmkmf fails to eport a C or C++ compiler.

    o	expand.grid() was constructing a data frame 'by hand' and so
	setting integer row.names (which are documented to be
	character).  It now sets character row names, and
	row.names.data.frame() coerces to character.

    o	qbeta() used == on volatile doubles for its convergence test,
	which failed with gcc 3.3.x on ix86 Linux.  We now use a less
	fragile test (and lose a negligible amount of accuracy).

    o	ls.str() was missing inherits=FALSE, and so could have
	reported on an object of the same name but a different mode in
	the enclosure of the given environment.

    o	logLik.nls assumed that sigma^2 had been estimated, but did
	not count this in the 'df' attribute.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.2.1 patched


INSTALLATION CHANGES


    o	The macro SOCKLEN_T has been replaced by R_SOCKLEN_T to work
	around a problem with the headers of AIX 5.3.


BUG FIXES

    o	sub(fixed = TRUE) could get wrong the length of the character
	string for elements of the result after the first.

    o	legend() worked out which elements of 'lty' were valid before
	resizing 'lty', and so could fail if 'lty' was a different
	length from 'legend'.

    o	str(<dendrogram>) sometimes used much too many spaces (in 2.2.x).

    o	eigen(eispack=TRUE) accessed areas off the matrix in some
	circumstances (some asymmetric matrices with both complex
	conjugate pair and real eigenvalues).

    o	strptime() in 2.2.1 sometimes did not set $isdst when it was
	previously set.

    o	Another case of infinite influence has been worked around.
	(An addendum to PR#8367.)

    o	qr.coef() worked incorrectly with multiple rhs in the
	LAPACK-using cases. (PR#8476/8)

    o	rbind.data.frame() gave a corrupt data frame if one of the
	named arguments was a zero-row data frame. (PR#8506)

    o	Checks for NULL in the rho argument of the C-level findVar
	function have been added.

    o	The C-level substitute function was handling NULL in its 'rho'
	argument incorrectly.

    o	The code for pgamma() introduced in 2.1.0 failed for large
	values of 'shape' where the previous code was perfectly
	acceptable, despite the claim to be uniformly better.  For
	example, pgamma(0.9e100, 1e100) was NaN.  (PR#8528)

    o	There was no command 'ls' in browser() nor 'next' in debug(),
	despite the documentation (which has been corrected).
	Command 'where' in the browser() no longer changes to
	step-though mode.

    o	factor.scope() could report incorrectly that interaction terms
	were not in the upper scope when such terms in the model and
	the upper scope had different orders for the main effects.
	(Another manifestation of PR#7842.)

    o	The "lm" method of drop1() was giving incorrect results for
	weighted fits (since deviance.lm() was called on a non-"lm" object).

    o	dotchart() was miscalculating the space for the labels in the
	left margin.  (PR#8681)

    o	r <- glm(.....); all.equal(r,r) # now gives TRUE instead of an error
    
    o	plot.acf() with a multiple time series was sometimes
	miscalculating the 'ylim' value for the plot after the first.
	(PR#8705)

From Achim.Zeileis at wu-wien.ac.at  Mon May 29 20:46:35 2006
From: Achim.Zeileis at wu-wien.ac.at (Achim Zeileis)
Date: Mon, 29 May 2006 20:46:35 +0200
Subject: useR! 2006: final program
Message-ID: <20060529204635.4a8cf908.Achim.Zeileis@wu-wien.ac.at>

Dear useRs,

the final scientific program for "useR! 2006", the second R user
conference taking place in Vienna June 15-17, is now available online at

	http://www.R-project.org/useR-2006/

The registration is open until May 31, so you still have two days to
register for this exciting event where you can meet 400 other useRs,
attend 160 presentations and participate in some of the pre-conference
tutorials given by prominent members of the R community.

Subject: R 2.3.1 is released
Message-ID: <x2ejy9i6wj.fsf@viggo.kubism.ku.dk>


I've rolled up R-2.3.1.tar.gz a short while ago. This version contains
several minor fixups and removes a couple of bad bugs. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it (in a short while) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.3.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.
 
There is also a version split for floppies. (This will be the last
time we build those.)

Here is the relevant bit of the NEWS file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.3.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	In lm() and glm(), offsets are allowed to be length 1 (and
	if so are replicated to the number of cases).

    o	The \uxxxx notation for Unicode characters in input strings
	can now be used on any platform which supports MBCS, even if
	the current locale is not MBCS (provided that the Unicode
	character is valid in the current character set).

    o	The quasibinomial() family now allows the "cauchit" link. (PR#8851)

    o	edit.data.frame() no longer (silently) coerces character columns
	to factor.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	The variables controlling stack checking are made available via
        Rinterface.h to front-ends embedding R: see 'Writing R Extensions'

    o	R_SignalHandlers (defined in Rinterface.h) can be set to 0 to
        suppress the R signal handlers in front-ends embedding R.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	There have been a number of changes to help installation on
	platforms that no one had beta-tested.

	- Changes related to older header files, e.g. on Redhat 8.0/9.

	- Problems with 'make install' on older (<3) versions of bash
          on Solaris and elsewhere.

	- AIX 5.2/gcc issues with needing -lm when making modules X11
          and vfonts.

	- Some versions of Solaris and AIX had a fcntl.h that
	  redefined 'open' to be 'open64' and thereby broke
	  compilation of src/main/connections.c and elsewhere.

    o   'make uninstall' works better on a build using a named
	subarchitecture.


BUG FIXES

    o	min(), max(), sum() and prod() gave nonsensical answers with
	an empty list or raw argument.

    o	sum() on a data frame did not allow multiple arguments.	 (PR#8385)

    o	charmatch() and pmatch() did not specify they applied only to
	character vectors.  Now they do, and attempt to coerce 'x' and
	'target' to character before attempting matching.

    o	The Summary() methods for data.frame, Date, POSIXct, POSIXlt
	and difftime all required an argument which can match 'x',
	although the generics did not.

    o	regexpr() now accepts 0-length 'text' inputs.

    o	help.search() no longer errors out on a wrongly installed package
	(with no "hsearch.rds" file).

    o	The LaTeX version of the package reference manual was omitting
	some topics, and was not sorting the foo-package topic first.

    o	Serializing (e.g. via save()) is better protected against C
	stack overflow, which will now abort the conversion but no
	longer crashes the R process on some platforms.

    o	rbind()ing dataframes with a single row could lead to a
	corrupt data frame (a problem with the fix to PR#8506).

    o	plot(lm(y ~ 1)) now works also for 'which = 5'.

    o	dbeta(0, 1, a, 0) now correctly gives 'a' (limit) instead of 0,
	and dbeta(0, a, b, ncp) now returns Inf instead of NaN.

    o	demo(Hershey) was failing on the Cyrillic octal codes in locales
	(e.g. UTF-8) in which these are invalid.

    o	mean() on an integer (or logical) vector was treating NAs as
	actual values (unless na.rm = TRUE).

    o	mean() on a complex vector was calculated incorrectly in
        code to improve precision (PR#8842, John Peters).

    o	Graphical parameters bg, cex, col, lty, and lwd were being
	checked as being of length one even by functions such as
	title() that ignored them.  (Functions such as lines() and
	points() allow them to be of length > 1, so they might be
	passed through ... to other high-level graphical functions
	which then used to reject them.)

    o	str() now is fast again for large character vectors.

    o	edit() would default the environment of a function to .BaseEnv,
	instead of to .GlobalEnv.

    o	lm() and glm() coerce their 'weights' and 'offset' values to
	vector to avoid problems with specifying them as 1D or n x 1
	arrays.

    o	image() with one or both axes on log scales would give a
	spurious warning; contour() would give an error.

    o	legend() with log axes would place the title in the wrong place.

    o	edit.data.frame() was not returning factors edited with
	factor.mode="numeric" to factors.

    o	edit.matrix() tried to set rownames and colnames from the
	original matrix even if the sizes had been altered, and
	ignored changes made to the column names.  edit.row.names has
	a more sensible default (if the rownames are non-NULL).

    o	bindingIsLocked() was returning invalid values of a logical
	vector on some platforms.

    o	merge.data.frame() did not make the column names unique (by
	appending elements of 'suffixes') when performing a Cartesian
	product.  (PR#8676)

    o	rbind.data.frame() matches up the names of columns (which was
	undocumented), but failed to do so when checking if it was
	dealing with a factor column.  (PR#8868)

	If rbind() was used on data frames with duplicated names it
	produced a corrupt data frame.

    o	dt(x, df, ncp= not.0) now longer gives erratic values for
	|x| < ~1e-12.  (PR#8874)

    o	\code{\linkS4class{.}} now works.

    o	ccf() aligns time series by ts.intersect() rather than
	ts.union() and so is less likely to need a non-default
	na.action.  (PR#8893)

    o	optim(method="CG") could return a value that did not
	correspond to $par for very badly behaved functions on which
	the second phase of the line search failed.  (PR#8786)

    o	print.ts() could fail on a corrupt time series: it now warns and
	does the best it can.

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.4.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	The startup message now prints first the version string and
	then the copyright notice (to be more similar to R --version).

    o	save() by default evaluates promise objects.  The old behaviour
	(to save the promise and its evaluation environment) can be
	obtained by setting the new argument 'eval.promises' to FALSE.
	(Note that this does not apply to promises embedded in
	objects, only to top-level objects.)

    o	The functions read.csv(), read.csv2(), read.delim(),
	read.delim2() now default their 'comment.char' argument to "".
	(These functions are designed to read files produced by other
	software, which might use the # character inside fields, but
	are unlikely to use it for comments.)

    o	The bindings in the base environment/namespace (currently the
	same thing) are now locked.  This means that the values of
	base functions cannot be changed except via
	assignInNamespace() and similar tricks.

    o	[[ on a factor now returns a one-element factor (and not an
	integer), as.list() on a factor returns a list of one-element
	factors (and not of character vectors), and unlist() on a list
	of factors returns a factor (and not an integer vector).
	These changes may affect the results of sapply() and lapply()
	applied to factors.

    o	mauchly.test() now returns the W statistic (for comparability
	with SAS and SPSS), rather than the z (which was accidentally
	not named in the output)

    o	sort(x, decreasing = FALSE, ...) is now a generic function.
	This means that 'partial' is no longer the second argument,
	and calls which used positional matching may be incorrect: we
	try to detect them.

    o	See the section on 'Changes to S4 methods': all packages
	depending on 'methods' need to be re-installed.


NEW FEATURES

    o	agrep(), grep(), strwrap(), strtrim(), substr() and
	related functions now coerce arguments which should be
	character via as.character() rather than internally (so method
	dispatch takes place, e.g. for factors).

	chartr(), charfold(), tolower() and toupper() now coerce their
	main argument if necessary to a character vector via
	as.character().

	Functions which work element-by-element on character vectors
	to give a character result now preserve attributes including
	names, dims and dimnames (as suggested by the Blue Book
	p. 144).  Such functions include charfold(), chartr(), gsub(),
	strtrim(), sub(), substr(), tolower() and toupper().  (Note
	that coercion of a non-character argument may lose the
	attributes.)

	agrep(value = TRUE) preserves names for compatibility with
	grep().

	nchar() has always preserved dims/dimnames (undocumented
	before) and now also preserves names.


    o	.Deprecated and .Defunct take a new parameter, msg, that allows
	for the specification of the message printed and facilitates
	deprecation of calling sequences etc.

    o	.Fortran() will map 'name' to lower case, and will work with
	'name' containing underscores.

    o	The default is now .saveRDS(compress = TRUE)

    o	The :: operator now also works for packages without name spaces
	that are on the search path.

    o	[[ on a list does not duplicate the extracted element unless
	necessary.  (It did not duplicate in other cases, e.g. a
	pairlist.)

    o	argsAnywhere() works like args() on non-exported functions.

    o	as.data.frame() gains a '...' argument.

    o	Added an as.data.frame() method for class "ftable".

    o	as.list(<an expression>) is now handled by internal code and
	no longer loses attributes such as names.

	as.list(<a list>) no longer duplicates (unnecessarily).

    o	as.POSIX[cl]t can now convert character strings containing
	fractional seconds.

    o	attach() can now attach a copy of an environment.

    o	available.packages() and installed.packages() gain a 'fields'
	argument thanks to Seth Falcon.

    o	axis.POSIXct() uses a different algorithm for ranges of 2 to 50
	days that will mark days at midnight in the current timezone
	(even if the graph crosses a DST change).

    o	body<-() and formals<-() default to envir = environment(fun),
	that is they do not by default change the environment.
	(Previously they changed it to parent.frame().)

    o	New function combn(x, m, ..) for computing on all combinations of
	size 'm' (for small 'm' !).

    o	The cumxxx() functions now handle logical/integer arguments
	separately from numeric ones, and so return an integer result
	where appropriate.

    o	data.frame() has a new argument 'stringsAsFactor'.  This and
	the default for read.table(as.is=) are set from the new global
	option 'stringsAsFactors' via the utility function
	default.stringsAsFactors().

    o	dev.interactive() now has an optional argument 'orNone'.

    o	df() now has a noncentrality argument 'ncp', based on a
	contribution by Peter Ruckdeschel.

    o	example() gains an argument 'ask' which defaults to "TRUE when
	sensible", but the default can be overridden by setting option
	'example.ask'.

    o	expand.grid() now has an argument 'KEEP.OUT.ATTRS' which can
	suppress (the potentially expensive) "out.attrs" attribute. It no
	longer returns an extraneous 'colnames' attribute.

    o	The subset and subassign methods for factors now handle factor
	matrices, and dim() can be set on a factor.

    o	There is now a format() method for class "ftable".

    o	head(x, n) and tail(x, n) now also work for negative arguments,
	thanks to Vincent Goulet.

    o	head.matrix() and tail.matrix() are no longer hidden, to be used
	for building head() and tail() methods for other classes.

    o	If help() finds multiple help files for a given topic, a menu
	of titles is used to allow interactive choice.

    o	help.search() now rebuilds the database if 'package' specifies a
	package not in the saved database.

    o	hist(*, plot = FALSE) now warns about unused arguments.

    o	history() gains a 'pattern' argument as suggested by Romain
	Francois.

    o	integer(0) now prints as that rather than "numeric(0)" (it
	always deparsed as "integer(0)").

    o	interaction(..., drop=TRUE) now gives the same result as
	interaction(...)[,drop=TRUE] (it used to sometimes give a
	different order for the levels).

    o	lag.plot() produces a conventional plot (not setting mfrow) if
	only one plot is to be produced.

    o	lapply() does much less copying.  Vector X are handled without
	duplication, and other types are coerced via as.list().	 (As a
	result, package 'boot' runs its examples 4% faster.)

	lapply(<a pairlist>) now coerces to a list (rather than traverse
	the pairlist from the beginning for each item).

    o	legend() has new parameters 'box.lwd' and 'box.lty'.

    o	lines() gains a simple method for isoreg() results.

    o	load() no longer coerces pairlists to lists (which was
	undocumented, but has been happening since 1998).

    o	make.link() now returns an object of class "link-glm".
	The GLM families accept an object of this class for their
	'link' argument, which allows user-specified link functions.
	Also, quasi() allows user-specified variance functions.

    o	mapply() uses names more analogously to lapply(), e.g..

    o	matplot() now accepts a 'bg' argument similarly to plot.default() etc.

    o	median() is now generic, and its default method uses mean()
	rather than sum() and so is more widely applicable (e.g. to dates).

    o	Dummy functions memory.size() and memory.limit() are available
	on Unix-alikes, for people who have not noticed that documentation
	is Windows-specific.

    o	merge() works more efficiently when there are relatively few
	matches between the data frames (for example, for 1-1
	matching).  The order of the result is changed for 'sort = FALSE'.

    o	merge() now inserts row names as a character column and not a
	factor: this makes the default sort order more comprehensible.

    o	Raw, complex and character vectors are now allowed in model
	frames (there was a previously undocumented restriction to
	logical, integer and numeric types.).  Character vectors in a
	formula passed to model.matrix() are converted to factors and
	coded accordingly.

    o	modifyList() utility, typically for housekeeping nested lists.

    o	x <- 1:20; y <- rnorm(x); nls(y ~ A*exp(-x^2/sig)) no longer
	returns an unhelpful error message.  In this and similar cases, it
	now tries a wild guess for starting values.

    o	Ops.difftime() now handles unary minus and plus.

    o	Ops.Date() and Ops.POSIXt() now allow character arguments
	(which are coerced to the appropriate class before comparison,
	for Ops.POSIXt() using the current time zone).

    o	There is a new option(max.contour.segments = 25000) which can be
	raised to allow extremely complex contour lines in contour()
	and contourLines().  (PR#9205)

    o	options(max.print = N) where N defaults to 99999 now cuts printing
	of large objects after about N entries.	 print(x, ..., max = N)
	does the same for the default method and those building on
	print.default().

	options("menu.graphics") controls if graphical menus should be
	used when available.

	options("par.ask.default") allows the default for par("ask")
	to be set for a newly-opened device.  (Defaults to FALSE, the
	previous behaviour.)

	The way option("papersize") is set has been changed.  On
	platforms which support the LC_PAPER locale category, the
	setting is taken first from the R_PAPERSIZE environment
	variable at run time, then from the LC_PAPER category
	("letter" for _US and _CA locales and "a4" otherwise).	On
	other platforms (including Windows and older Unixen), the
	choice is unchanged.

    o	package.skeleton() gains arguments 'namespace' and
	'code_files'.

    o	par(ask=TRUE) now only applies to interactive R sessions.

    o	parse() now returns up to 'n' expressions, rather than fill
	the expressions vector with NULL.  (This is now compatible
	with S.)

    o	The 'version' argument for pdf() is now increased
	automatically (with a warning) if features which need a higher
	level are used.

    o	pie() now allows expressions for 'labels', and empty slices.

    o	There is a new '%.%' operator for mathematical annotations
	(plotmath) which draws a centred multiplication dot
	(a \cdot in LaTeX), thanks to Uwe Ligges.

    o	predict.lm() gains a 'pred.var' argument.  (Wishlist PR#8877.)

    o	print.summary.{aov,glm,lm,nls} and print.{aov,glm} make use of
	naprint() to report when na.action altered the model frame.

    o	print.table(T, zero.print=ch) now also replaces 0 by ch when T is
	non-integer with integer entries.

    o	Recursive rapply() which is similar to lapply but used
	recursively and can restrict the classes of elements to which
	it is applied.

    o	r2dtable() has been moved to package 'stats'.

    o	New function read.DIF() to read Data Interchange Format files,
	and (on Windows) this format from the clipboard.

    o	New experimental function readNEWS() to read R's own "NEWS" file
	and similarly formatted ones.

    o	readLines() has a new argument 'warn' to suppress warnings:
	the default behaviour is still to warn.

    o	reg.finalizer() has a new argument 'onexit' to parallel the
	C-level equivalent R_RegisterFinalizerEx.

    o	rep() is now a primitive function and under some conditions
	very much faster: rep.int() is still a little faster (but does
	less). (Because it is primitive there are minor changes to the
	call semantics: see the help page.)

    o	The 'row.names' of a data frame may be stored internally as an
	integer or character vector.  This can result in considerably
	more compact storage (and more logical row names from rbind)
	when the row.names are 1:nrow(x).  However, such data frames
	are not compatible with earlier versions of R: this can be
	ensured by supplying a character vector as 'row.names'.

	row.names() will always return a character vector, but direct
	access to the attribute may not.

	The internal storage of row.names = 1:n just records 'n', for
	efficiency with very long vectors.

	The "row.names" attribute must be a character or integer
	vector, and this is now enforced by the C code.

    o	The "data.frame" and "matrix" methods for rowsum() gain an 'na.rm'
	argument.

    o	Experimental support for memory-use profiling via Rprof(),
	summaryRprof(), Rprofmem() and tracemem().

    o	save.image() [also called by sys.save.image() and hence from q()]
	now defaults to saving compressed binary images.  To revert to
	the previous behaviour set option "save.image.defaults": see
	?save.image.

    o	There is a new primitive seq.int() which is slightly more
	restricted than seq() but often very much faster, and new
	primitives seq_along() and seq_len() which are faster still.

    o	serialize(connection = NULL) now returns a raw vector (and not
	a character string).  unserialize() accepts both old and new
	formats (and has since 2.3.0).

    o	setwd() now returns the previously current directory (invisibly).

    o	The function sort() is now sort.int(), with a new generic
	function sort() which behaves in the same way (except for the
	order of its argument list) for objects without a class, and
	relies on the '[' method for objects with a class (unless a
	specific method has been written, as it has for class "POSIXlt").

    o	sort.list() now implements complex vectors (PR#9039), and how
	complex numbers are sorted is now documented.

    o	spline() and splinefun() now follow approx[fun] to have an argument
	'ties = mean' which makes them applicable also when 'x' has
	duplicated values.

    o	str(x) does not print the S3 "class" attribute when it is the
	same as 'mode' (which is printed anyway, possibly abbreviated)
	and it puts it beside mode for atomic objects such as S3 class
	"table".

    o	str(<data.frame>) now outputs 'data.frame' instead of
	`data.frame'; this may affect some strict (Package) tests.

    o	str() now takes also its defaults for 'vec.len' and 'digits.d'
	from options('str') which can be set by the new strOptions().

    o	symnum() has a new argument 'numeric.x' particularly useful for
	handling 0/1 data.

    o	Sys.getlocale() and Sys.setlocale() support LC_MESSAGES,
	LC_PAPER and LC_MEASUREMENT if the platform does.

    o	Sweave has a new options 'pdf.encoding' and 'pdf.version' for
	its Rweave driver.

    o	The character vector used by an output textConnection() has
	a locked binding whilst the connection is open.

	There is a new function textConnectionValue() to retrieve the
	value of an output textConnection().

    o	traceback() gains a 'max.lines' argument.
	.Traceback is no longer stored in the workspace.

    o	warning(immediate. = TRUE) now applies to
	getOption("warn") < 0 and not just == 0.

    o	warnings() is now an accessor function for 'last.warning' (which
	is no longer stored in the workspace) with a print() method.


    o	The internal internet download functions have some new
	features from libxml 2.6.26.

    o	There is an option "HTTPUserAgent" to set the User Agent in R
	download requests etc.	Patch from S. Falcon.

    o	PCRE has been updated to version 6.7.

    o	The C function substituteList now has tail recursion expanded
	out, so C stack overflow is less likely.  (PR#8141, fix by
	Kevin Hendricks)

    o	The (somewhat soft) 1023/4 byte limit on command lines is now
	documented in 'An Introduction to R'.

    o	The maximum number of open connections has been increased from
	50 to 128.

    o	There is a new manual 'R Internals' on R internal stuctures
	plus the former appendices of 'Writing R Extensions'.

    o	The autoloads introduced at the package re-organization have been
	almost completely removed: the one that remains is for ts().

    o	The setting of the various Java configuration variables has been
	improved to refer to JAVA_HOME, and they are now documented in
	the R-admin manual.

    o	It is (again) possible to calculate prediction intervals from
	"lm" objects for the original data frame, now with a warning
	that the intervals refer to future observations.  Weighted
	intervals have also been implemented, with user-specifiable
	weights. Warnings are given in cases where the default
	behaviour might differ from user expectations.  See the
	?predict.lm for details.


CHANGES TO S4 METHODS

    o	The default prototype object for S4 classes will have its own
	internal type in 2.4.0, as opposed to being an empty list (the
	cause of several errors in the code up to 2.3.1).  Note that old
	binary objects, including class definitions, will be
	inconsistent with the type, and should be recreated.

    o	S4 method dispatch has been completely revised to use cached
	generic functions and to search for the best match among
	inherited methods.  See ?Methods and
	http://developer.r-project.org/howMethodsWork.pdf

    o	Objects created from an S4 class are now marked by an internal flag,
	tested by isS4() in R and by macro IS_S4_OBJECT() in C.	 This
	is an efficient and reliable test, and should replace all
	earlier heuristic tests.

    o	Some changes have been made to automatic printing of S4
	objects, to make this correspond to a call to show(), as per
	'Programming with Data'.

    o	S4 generic and class definitions are now cached when the related
	package is loaded.  This should improve efficiency and also
	avoid anomalous situations in which a class or generic cannot
	be found.

    o	trace() now creates a new S4 class for the traced object if
	required.  This allows tracing of user-defined subclasses of
	"function".


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The re-named tcltk functions tkcmd, tkfile.tail, tkfile.dir,
	tkopen, tkclose, tkputs, tkread are now defunct.

    o	Argument 'col' of bxp() has been removed: use 'boxfill'.

    o	Use of NULL as an environment is now an error.

    o	postscriptFont() is defunct: use Type1Font().

    o	La.chol() and La.chol2inv() are defunct (they were the same as
	the default options of chol() and chol2inv).

    o	La.svd(method = "dgesvd") is defunct.

    o	Files install.R and R_PROFILE.R in packages are now ignored
	(with a warning).

    o	The following deprecated command-line options to INSTALL have
	been removed (use the fields in the DESCRIPTION file instead):
	-s --save --no-save --lazy --no-lazy --lazy-data --no-lazy-data

    o	Graphical parameter 'tmag' is obsolete.

    o	mauchley.test() (package 'stats') is now defunct.

    o	symbol.C() and symbol.For() are deprecated.  They are required in
	S for use with is.loaded(), but are not so required in R.

    o	load()ing an object saved in one of the formats used prior to
	R 1.4.0 is deprecated.	Such objects should be re-saved in the
	current format.

    o	save(version = 1) is now deprecated.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	The convenience function ScalarLogical now coerces all
	non-zero non-NA values to TRUE.

    o	The vector accessor functions such as INTEGER, REAL and
	SET_VECTOR_ELT now check that they are called on the
	correct SEXPTYPE (or at least on a compatible one).  See
	`Writing R Extensions' for the details and for a stricter
	test regime.

    o	It is no longer possible to pass list variables to
	.C(DUP = FALSE): it would have given rise to obscure garbage
	collection errors.

    o	allocString is now a macro, so packages using it will need to
	be reinstalled.

    o	R_ParseVector was returning with object(s) protected in the
	parser if the status was PARSE_INCOMPLETE or PARSE_ERROR.

    o	There is a new function Rf_endEmbeddedR to properly terminate
	a session started by Rf_initEmbeddedR, and both are now
	available on Windows as well as on Unix-alikes.	 These and
	related functions are declared in a new header <Rembedded.h>.

	If R_TempDir is set when embedded R is initialized it is
	assumed to point to a valid session temporary directory: see
	`Writing R Extensions'.

    o	There is a new interface allowing one package to make C routines
	available to C code in other packages.	The interface consists
	of the routines R_RegisterCCallable and R_GetCCallable.	 These
	functions are declared in <R_ext/Rdynload.h>. This interface
	is experimental and subject to change.

	In addition, a package can arrange to make use of header
	files in another (already installed) package via the
	'LinkingTo' field in the DESCRIPTION file: see 'Writing R
	Extensions'.


UTILITIES

    o	R CMD SHLIB now handles (as linker commands) -L*, -l* and *.a.

    o	R CMD check now:

	- warns if there are non-ASCII characters in the R code (as
	  these will likely be syntax errors in some locale).

	- tests Rd cross-references by default, and tests for
	  (syntactically) valid CITATION metadata.

	- tests that the package can be loaded, and that the package
	  and namespace (if there is one) can each be loaded in
	  startup code (before the standard packages are loaded).

	- tests for empty 'exec' or 'inst' directories.

	- checks if $(FLIBS) is used when $(BLAS_LIBS) is.

	- checks that all packages (except non-S4-using standard
	  packages) used in ::, :::, library() and require() calls are
	  declared in the DESCRIPTION file, and 'methods' is declared if
	  S4 classes or methods are set.

	- throws an error if the standard packages 'methods' and
	  'stats4' are imported from in the NAMESPACE file and not
	  declared in the DESCRIPTION file.

    o	The test script produced by massage-Examples.pl no longer
	creates objects in the base environment.

    o	New utilties R CMD Stangle and R CMD Sweave for extracting S/R
	code from and processing Sweave documentation, respectively.

    o	The DESCRIPTION file of packages may contain an 'Enhances:'
	field.

    o	An R CMD javareconf script has been added to allow Java
	configuration to be updated even after R has been installed.


INSTALLATION

    o	The C function realpath (used by normalizePath()) is hidden on
	some systems and we try harder to find it.

    o	There is a new option --enable-BLAS-shlib, which compiles the
	BLAS into a dynamic library -lRblas and links against that.
	For the pros and cons see the R-admin manual.

	The defaults are now --without-blas (so you have explicitly to
	ask for an external BLAS), and --enable-BLAS-shlib unless
	a usable external BLAS is found or on AIX or on MacOS X 10.2
	and earlier.

    o	MacOS X did not like having LSAME in both BLAS and LAPACK
	libraries, so it is no longer part of the R-internal LAPACK.
	We now require an external BLAS to provide LSAME: it seems
	that nowadays all do.

    o	The configure test for 'whether mixed C/Fortran code can be
	run' has been improved as on one system that test passed but
	the Fortran run-time library was broken.

    o	A precious configure variable DEFS can be set to pass defines
	(e.g. -DUSE_TYPE_CHECKING_STRICT) to C code when compiling R.

    o	There is now a test for visible __libc_stack_end on Linux
	systems (since it is not visible on some recent glibc's
	built from the sources).

    o	MacOS X 10.4 and higher now use two-level namespaces, single
	module in a shared library and allow undefined symbols to be
	resolved at run-time. This implies that common symbols are now
	allowed in package libraries. --enable-BLAS-shlib is supported
	for internal BLAS, external BLAS framework and external static
	BLAS.  An external dynamic library BLAS is NOT supported. (But
	it can be easily used by replacing internal BLAS library file
	later.)	 MacOS X < 10.4 does not support --enable-BLAS-shlib.

    o	Dynamic libraries and modules use a flat namespace on MacOS X
	10.4 and higher if either Xcode tools don't support dynamic
	lookup (Xcode < 2.3) or the FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE environment
	variable is set.  (The latter was introduced temporarily for
	testing purposes and may go away anytime.)

    o	configure now defaults to 'run-time linking' on AIX
	(and AIX < 4.2 is no longer allowed), using -bexpall rather
	than export/import files.  If this works, it allows R to be
	built in the same way as other Unix-alikes, including with R
	as a shared library and with a shared BLAS.

    o	The "mac.binary" package type now defaults to universal
	binary.  If a repository supports architecture-specific Mac
	binaries, they can be requested by using "mac.binary.xxx" in
	contrib.url(), where xxx is the desired architecture.


BUG FIXES

    o	The name of a Fortran symbol reported to be missing by
	.Fortran() is now the actual name.  (What was reported to be
	an 'entry point' was missing the common leading underscore.)

    o	print() on a MBCS character string now works properly a
	character at a time rather than a byte at time.	 (This does
	not affect MBCSs like UTF-8 and the Windows DBCSes which have
	non-ASCII lead bytes and always worked correctly.)

    o	glm() now recalculates the null deviance whenever there is an
	offset (even if it is exactly zero to avoid a discontinuity in
	that case, since the calculations with and without offset are
	done by different algorithms).

    o	Amongst families, quasi() accepted an expression for link and
	no other did.  Now all accept an expression which evaluates to
	a one-element character vector (although e.g. 'logit' is taken
	as a name and not an expression).

    o	trace() now accepts arguments where= and signature= for the
	old-style trace (no tracer or exit, edit==FALSE) and just
	prints a message on entry.  Also the undocumented feature of
	where=function now works for generic functions as well.

    o	callNextMethod() failed for recursive use when the methods had
	nonstandard argument lists.  Now enforces the semantic rule
	that the inheritance is fixed when the method containing the
	callNextMethod() is installed.	See Details in the documentation.

    o	UseMethod() looked for the defining environment of 'generic' as
	if it were the current function, although some functions are
	generic for methods of a different generic.

	Lookup for S3 methods is confined to functions: previously a
	non-function 'fun.class' could have masked a function of the
	same name.

    o	Line types (lty) specified as hex strings were documented not to
	allow zero, but some devices accepted zero and handled it in a
	device-dependent way.  Now it is an error on all devices.
	(PR#8914)

    o	Subassignment for a time series can no longer extend the series:
	it used to attempt to but failed to adjust the tsp attributes.
	Now window() must be used.

    o	Function AIC() in package 'stats4' was not dispatching correctly
	on S4 classes via logLik() because of namespace issues.

    o	Subsetting LANGSXPs could break the call-by-value illusion.
	(PR#7924) (patch from Kevin Hendricks).

    o	parse() with n > 1 gave a syntax error if fewer than n statements
	were available.

    o	parse() with n > 1 gave strange results on some syntax errors.
	(PR#8815)

    o	lag.plot() now respects graphical parameters for the axes.

    o	Using a wrong link in family() now gives more consistent error
	messages.

    o	sort.list(method="radix") works on factors again.

    o	object.size() is more accurate for vector objects (it takes into
	account the smaller header and also the fixed sizes used in
	the node classes for small vector objects).

    o	addmargins(T, ...) now returns a "table" when 'T' is a "table", as
	its help page has always suggested.

    o	remove() now explicitly precludes removing variables from
	baseenv() and throws an error (this was previously ignored).

    o	Saving the workspace at the end of a session now works as has
	long been intended, that is it is saved only if something has
	been added/deleted/changed during the current session.

    o	The search for bindings in <<-, ->> and assign(inherits=TRUE)
	was omitting the base package, although this was not
	documented.  Now the base package is included (but most
	bindings there are locked).

    o	dweibull(0, shape) was NaN not Inf for shape < 1.  Also, the
	help for dgamma and dweibull gave support as x > 0, but
	returned non-zero values for x = 0.  (PR#9080)

    o	Subsetting arrays no longer preserves attributes (it was
	removed for matrices in 1998).

    o	The "factor" method of as.character() no longer maps level
	"NA" to "<NA>" (a legacy of before there were NA character
	strings).

    o	terms(keep.order=TRUE) was not returning a valid "order"
	attribute.

    o	The DLL registration code was not freeing .External symbols.

    o	The internet download routines expected URLs of less than 4096
	bytes, but did not check.  Now this is checked, and http:// URLs
	are allowed to be up to 40960 bytes.

    o	parse(n=-1) threw a stack-imbalance error, and parse(n=3) did
	not cope correctly with EOF during input.

    o	Zero-column data frames had no names (rather than character(0)).

    o	by() and acf() could get confused when they used very long
	expressions as names.

    o	residuals(<glm object>, type="working") was NA for cases with
	zero weight (whereas they are well-defined even though the
	case was not used during the fitting) and the actual value is
	now returned.  This allows residuals to be computed from fits
	with 'y = FALSE'.

	The residuals in a fitted "glm" object are computed more
	accurately: the previous formula was subject to cancellation.

    o	loess() now checks the validity of its 'control' argument.

    o	rownames(<0-row matrix>, do.NULL=FALSE) was wrong.  (PR#9136)

    o	apply() now works as documented when applied over 2 or more
	margins with one of zero extent.  (It used to drop dimensions.)

    o	head() and tail() now also work row-wise for "table" and "ftable"
	objects.

    o	NextMethod() could throw an error/crash if called from a method
	that was called directly rather than from a generic (so
	.Method was unset).

    o	order(x, na.last = NA) failed for a zero-length x.

    o	grep(pat, x, value = TRUE, perl = L) preserved names for
	L == TRUE && !is.na(pat) but not otherwise.  Now it always does.

    o	[rc]bind() now find registered methods and not just visible ones.

    o	Printing a factor no longer ignores attributes such as names and
	dim/dimnames.

    o	Command-line arguments after --encoding were ignored.

    o	The check for impossible confidence levels was off by one in
	wilcox.test (PR#8557)

    o	[[ on an environment could create aliases. (PR#8457)

    o	pt() with a very small (or zero) non-centrality parameter could
	give an unduly stringent warning about 'full precision was not
	achieved'.  (PR#9171)

    o	writeChar() could segfault if 'nchars' was given silly values.

    o	qt() and rt() did not work for vector 'ncp', and qt() did not
	work for negative 'ncp'.

    o	ns() failed to work correctly when 'x' was of length one.

    o	identical() ignored tags on pairlists (including names of
	attributes) and required an identical ordering for
	attribute values in their pairlists.  Now names are compared
	on pairlists, and attribute sets are treated as unordered.

    o	If they were unused arguments supplied to a closure, only
	the first non-empty one was reported, despite the message.

	Unmatched empty arguments (such as f(1,,) for a function of
	one argument) were ignored.  They are now an error.

    o	Calling a builtin with empty arguments used to silently remove
	them (and this was undocumented).  Now this is an error unless
	builtin is c() or list() or there are only trailing empty
	arguments, when it is a warning (for the time being: this will
	be made an error in R 2.5.0).

    o	install.packages() ignored 'configure.args' if the vector was
	unnamed.

    o	biplot() now works if there are missing values in the data.

    o	biplot() now passes par() values to all four axes (not
	just those on sides 1 and 2).

    o	[.acf now handles an empty first index.

    o	Deparsing uses backticks more consistently to quote
	non-syntactic names.

    o	Assigning to the symbol in a for() loop with a
	list/expression/pairlist index could alter the index.  Now the
	loop variable is explicitly read-only.	(PR#9216)

    o	Using old.packages() (and hence update.packages()) on an empty
	(or non-existent) library failed with an obscure message.

    o	plot.xy() could segfault if supplied with an invalid 'col'
	argument.  (PR#9221)

    o	menu() with graphics=TRUE attempted to use Tcl/Tk on unix even
	if DISPLAY was not set (in which case Tk is not available and
	so the attempt is bound to fail).

    o	The print() method for 'dist' objects prints a matrix even for
	n = 2.

    o	The cumxxx functions were missing some PROTECTs and so could
	segfault on long vectors (especially with names or where
	coercion to numeric occurred).

    o	The X11() device no longer produces (apparently spurious)
	'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)' warnings when run from
	Rcmdr.

    o	legend() assumed that widths and heights of strings were positive,
	which they need not be in user coordinates with reversed axes.
	(In part, PR#9236)

    o	The plot() methods for "profile.nls" objects could get
	confused if 'which' had been used in the profile() call. (PR#9231)

    o	boxplot() did not passed named arguments (except graphics
	parameters) to bxp() as documented.  (PR#9183)

    o	Only genuinely empty statements act as 'return' in the
	browser, not say those starting with a comment char.  (PR#9063)

   o	summary.mlm() incorrectly used accessor functions to fake an
	"lm" object.  (PR#9191)

   o	prettyNum() was not preserving attributes, despite being
	explicitly documented to. (PR#8695)

   o	It was previously undocumented what happened if a graphical
	parameter was passed in both '...' and 'pars' to boxplot()
	and bxp(), and they behaved differently.  Now those passed in
	'...' have precedence in both cases.

    o	A failed subassignment could leave behind an object '*tmp*'.
	The fix also sometimes gives better error messages.

    o	Using SIGUSR1 on Unix now always terminates a session, and no
	longer is caught by browser contexts and restarts (such as try()).

    o   In the 'graphics' package, in-line 'font=5' was being ignored
        (report by Tom Cook).

    o   nls() looked for non-parameter arguments in a function call in
	the wrong scope (from the body of nls).

    o   Printing of complex numbers could misbehave when one of the
	parts was large (so scientific notation was used) and the
	other was so much smaller that it had no significant digits
	and should have been printed as zero (e.g. 1e80+3e44i).

    o	Using install.packages with type="mac.binary" and target path
	starting with ~ failed with a cryptic message while unpacking.

    o	getwd() now works correctly when the working directory is
	unavailable (e.g. unreadable).

    o	The alternative hypothesis in wilcox.test() was labelled by an
	unexplained quantity 'mu' which is now spelled out.

	The alternative hypothesis in ks.test() is clearer both in the
	documentation and in the result. (PR#5360)

Subject: R 2.4.1 is released
Message-ID: <45866A31.5070504@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.4.1.tar.gz a short while ago. This is a maintenance
release and fixes a number of mostly minor bugs. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it (in a short while) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.4.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.
 
        For the R Core Team

Here is the relevant bit of the NEWS file:

               CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.4.1


INSTALLATION

    o   The extraction of info from Subversion for an SVN checkout now
        also works for svn >= 1.4.0.  However, on Windows the 'Last
        Changed Date' will be in the local timezone, and not in GMT as
        previously.

    o   configure uses code borrowed from autoconf 2.60 to try harder to
        ensure that a C99-compliant compiler is used.  (It does so by
        appending to CC.)  This avoids problems with systems such as FC5
        which override CFLAGS and thereby lose flags such as -std=gnu99.


NEW FEATURES

    o   rainbow(), heat.colors(), terrain.colors(), topo.colors() and
        cm.colors() all gain an 'alpha' argument to be passed to hsv().

    o   dput() will give an incorrect representation of the row names
        of a data frame with integer row names.  This is now corrected
        when the object is recreated.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o   Using STRICT_R_HEADERS applies to more reported clashes with
        Windows headers, including Calloc and Realloc.  These and
        Free need to be prefixed by R_ when STRICT_R_HEADERS is defined.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   The previously undocumented behaviour of structure() in adding a
        class when specifying "tsp" or "levels" attributes is now
        deprecated (with a warning).


BUG FIXES

    o   Fixed warning() to use .dfltWarn intead of .dfltStop for default
        handling (PR#9274).

    o   R would slow down when the product of the length of a vector and
        the length of a character vector used to subset it exceeded 2^31.
        (PR#9280)

    o   merge() now allows zero-row data frames.

    o   add1.lm() had been broken by other changes for weighted fits.

    o   axis.POSIXct() would sometimes give the wrong labels.

    o   Help for a method call would fail. (PR#9291)

    o   gzfile() returned an object of class "file" not "gzfile". (PR#9271)

    o   load()ing from a connection had a logic bug in when it closed
        the connection. (PR#9271)

    o   The lowess() algorithm is unstable if the MAD of the residuals
        becomes (effectively) zero: R now terminates the iterations at
        that point.  (This may result in quite different answers.)

        The 'delta' argument was incorrectly documented.  (PR#9264)

    o   abbreviate() would only work for strings of up to 8191 bytes,
        but this was not checked.  Now longer strings are errors.

    o   Drawing X11 rotated text was buggy for VERY small (negative)
        angle of rotation.  Reported by Ben Bolker. (PR#9301)

    o   The X11 data editor would crash in an MBCS locale if R was
        compiled with FC's CFLAGS that add buffer overflow and
        stack-smashing detection.

    o   rect() was not accepting border=NA in some cases involving
        cross-hatching.

    o   Fixes to S4 group generics to ensure that the correct number of
        active arguments are in the signature of the group and all
        members.  Also a fix to keep the 'groupMembers' slot up to date.

    o   S4 group generic "Logic" (with '&', '|', but not '!') has been
        created, following the green book (apart from '!').

    o   removeClass() now takes care to remove any subclass references
        to the deleted class.

    o   mle() (in stats4) might not have worked as intended when the
        order of parameters in 'start' differed from that in the
        log-likelihood.  (PR#9313)

    o   dotchart() now properly restores par() settings after itself.

    o   system() on Mac OS X was blocking arbitrary signals during the
        call although only SIGPROF was meant to be blocked.

    o   methods cached via callNextMethod() and (sometimes) as() were
        being cached as directly specified although in fact they were
        inherited.  Caused problems in later search for inherited methods.

    o   str() works properly for method definitions and other S4-classed
        function objects.

    o   JAVA_LIBS are now set correctly on MacOS X.

    o   Fix null-termination issue suspected of causing crash with Fedora
        Extra RPMS (PR#9339, Justin Harrington, analysis and fix from Bill
        Dunlap).

    o   Namespaces restored via a saved session silently failed to cache
        their methods because the methods package was not yet
        attached.  Fixed by attaching methods before restoring data.

    o   rbind()ing a list to a data frame generated invalid row names,
        which were an error in 2.4.0. (PR#9346)

    o   boxplot.stats(x) now returns the correct minimum instead of an
        error for x <- c(1,Inf,Inf,Inf), and hence boxplot(x) "works".

    o   promptClass() now uses \linkS4class{<ClassName>} instead of
        of \link{<ClassName>-class}.

    o   gc() no longer reports nonsense values for the number of used
        Vcells if the true value exceeds 2^31 (and hence over 16Gb of
        heap is in use): it now reports NA. (PR#9345)

    o   rapply() now detects more user errors in supplying arguments.
(PR#9349)

    o   boxplot() was ignoring argument 'boxfill'. (PR#9352)

    o   plot.lm(which = 6, id.n = 0) did not work. (PR#9333)

    o   .deparseOpts("delayPromises") was not matching the C code,
        returning 64 rather than 32.

    o   bxp() could use partial matching on 'pars' when finding
        defaults for some of its parameters, e.g. a setting of 'cex.axis'
        in 'pars' or inline was used to set a default for 'outcex'.

    o   acf() now allows lag.max = 0 except when type="partial", and
        forces the lag 0 autocorrelation to 1. (PR#9360)

    o   hist(*, include.lowest=., right=., plot=FALSE) does not warn
        anymore, (PR#9356) and more.

    o   Some bugs in caching superclass/subclass relations and in
        removing those relations on detach and on removeClass() have
        been fixed.

    o   readBin() could return one too many strings if 'n' was an
        over-estimate. (PR#9361)

    o   A request for an opaque colour in the pdf() device after a
        translucent one did not set the transparency back to opaque in
        2.4.0.

        Semi-transparent background colours were not being plotted on
        the pdf() device.

    o   plot.lm(which=5) in the case of constant leverage re-ordered
        the factor levels but not the residuals, so the labelling by
        factor level was often incorrect.

    o   packBits() was not accepting a logical argument. (PR#9374)

    o   make install was omitting doc/FAQ and doc/RESOURCES.

    o   A two-sample t.test(x, y, var.equal=TRUE) did not allow one of the
        groups to be of size one.

    o   The "ts" method for print() failed on some corrupted objects
        of class "ts", e.g. those without a "tsp" attribute.

    o   structure() reordered the "class" value given if there was a
        "tsp" value specified.

    o   pairs() now does pass appropriate parts of '...' to the
        'diag.panel' argument. (PR#9384)

    o   plot.lm() was using an incorrect estimate of dispersion for
        some GLMs (including family=binomial and family=poisson).
        (PR#9316)

    o   Subsetting operators were setting R_Visible too early, so
        assignments in arguments could make the result invisible.
        (PR#9263)

    o   The tk-GUI was displaying a warning due to an extra comma in
        the list of manuals (PR#9396)

    o   packageDescription() now gives an explicit error on a corrupt
        DESCRIPTION file.

    o   There was a scoping issue with tcltk callbacks given as
        unevaluated expressions. This has only been partially fixed, a
        complete fix probably requires redesign.

    o   trace() had its return value documented incorrectly and was
        sometimes visible when it should not have been.

    o   pchisq() would sometimes use the wrong tail when calculating
        non-central probabilities with lower.tail = FALSE. (PR#9406)

    o   rm() could remove the wrong objects when passed an expression.
        (PR#9399)  Now only names are allowed in the '...' argument,
        and the incorrect documentation of what happened with
        character objects is corrected.

    o   url() was not supporting 'encoding' except on file:// URLs.
