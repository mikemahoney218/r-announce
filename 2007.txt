Subject: Subject: useR! 2007 --- programming competition
Message-ID: <461FCA13.2050107@stat.uiowa.edu>

R Users and Developers,

The first North American useR! to be held at Iowa State University,
Ames, Iowa, August 8-10, 2007, will include a programming
competition. The challenge:

     Develop a package useful for the analysis of large data sets.

     Your package could augment an existing package like biglm, for
     example, by providing graphical or numerical diagnostic tools, or by
     adding support methods for transparently handling data from a
     database. Alternatively, you could develop a package for fitting
     linear or generalized linear models to large data sets that takes an
     entirely different approach.

The winning team will receive a cash prize. The submission deadline is
June 30, 2007. Further details are available at the conference website
at http://www.user2007.org/.

As a reminder, we are also calling for papers for presentation at the
meeting.  Papers are encouraged in all areas, but particular emphasis
is given to work describing newly created or improved R
packages. Papers will be refereed and a best paper/presentation award
is likely.

Also, if you wish to apply for financial support, please send an
application to user2007 at iastate.edu by April 23 (include a brief CV
and a statement that demonstrates your eligibility, your need for
support, and an amount of support required - students should include
the name of their supervisor).

From: P.Dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard)
Date: Tue, 24 Apr 2007 12:34:31 +0200
Subject: R 2.5.0 is released
Message-ID: <462DDD37.4070700@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.5.0.tar.gz a short while ago. This is a development 
release which contains a number of new features. In particular:

  - Object name completion by integration of package 'rcompletion' by 
    Deepayan Sarkar
  - New recommended package 'codetools' by Luke Tierney
  - New Rscript front-end, which enables shell-like R scripting

also, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it (some time this evening) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.5.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. In case of 
impatience, try http://www.biostat.ku.dk/~pd/R-release

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.
 
        For the R Core Team

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.5.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	apropos(x) and find(x) now both only work for character 'x',
	and hence drop all non-standard evaluation behaviour.

    o	Data frames can have 'automatic' row names which are not
	converted to dimnames by as.matrix().  (Consequently, e.g.,
	t(.)  for such data frames has NULL column names.)  This
	change leads to memory reductions in several places, but can
	break code which assumes character dimnames for data frames
	derived from matrices.

	No existing R object is regarded as having 'automatic' row
	names, and it may be beneficial to recreate such objects via
	read.table() or data.frame().

    o	Using $ on an atomic vector now raises a warning, as does use
	on an S4 class for which a method has not been defined.

    o	The Unix-alike readline terminal interface now does
	command-completion for R objects, incorporating the
	functionality formerly in package 'rcompletion' by Deepayan
	Sarkar.  This can be disabled by setting the environment
	variable R_COMPLETION=FALSE when starting R (e.g. in
	~/.Renviron).  (Note that when this is enabled, filename
	completion no longer works for file paths containing R
	operators such as '+' and '-'.)


NEW FEATURES

    o	abbreviate() no longer has an 8191 byte limit on the size of
	strings it can handle.

    o	abs(x) now returns integer for integer or logical arguments.

    o	apropos() has a new argument 'ignore.case' which defaults to
	TRUE, potentially matching more than previously, thanks to a
	suggestion by Seth Falcon.

    o	args(), str() and print() now give the argument lists of primitive
	functions.

    o	as.matrix() gains the '...' argument that several packages have
	assumed it always had (and S-PLUS has).

    o	Manipulation of integers as roman numerals via as.roman() in
	package utils.

    o	attr() no longer treats name = NA_character_ as meaning
	name = "NA".

    o	binom.test() now allows a 'fuzz' for calculated integer values
	in its x and n arguments.

    o	boxplot(*, notch = TRUE) now warns when notches are outside
	hinges; related to PR#7690.

    o	New function callCC() providing a downward-only version of
	Scheme's call with current continuation.

    o	capabilities() now has a "profmem" entry indicating whether
	R has been compiled with memory profiling.

    o	colnames<-() and rownames<-() now handle data frames explicitly,
	so calling colnames<- on a data frame no longer alters the
	representation of the row names.

    o	commandArgs() has a new 'trailingOnly' argument to be used in
	conjunction with --args.

    o	contour() now passes graphical parameters in '...' to axis()
	and box().

    o	New data set 'crimtab' on Student(1908)'s 3000 criminals.

    o	cut.default() has a new argument 'ordered_result'.

    o	.deparseOpts() has two new options: "keepNA" to ensure that
	different types (logical, integer, double, character and
	complex) of NAs are distinguished, and "S_compatible" to
	suppress the use of R-specific features such as 123L and to
	deparse integer values of a double vector with a trailing
	decimal point.

	The 'keepInteger' option now uses the suffix 'L' rather than
	as.integer() where possible (unless all entries are NA or
	"S_compatible" is also set).

	Other deparse options can now be added to "all" (which has not
	for some time actually switched on all options).

	Integer sequences m:n are now deparsed in that form.

    o	deparse() and dput() now include "keepInteger" and "keepNA" in
	their defaults for the 'control' argument.

    o   detach() now takes another argument, unload, which indicates
        whether or not to unload the package and then only cleans
        up the S4 methods if the package successfully unloads.

    o	There are new constants NA_integer_, NA_real_, NA_complex_ and
	NA_character_ to denote NAs of those types, and they will be
	used in deparsing in place of as.integer(NA) etc unless
	.deparseOpts() includes "S_compatible".

    o	dev.print() now recognizes 'screen devices' as all those with
	an enabled display list, rather than a hard-coded set.

    o	Objects of class "difftime" are now handled more flexibly. The
	units of such objects can now be accessed via a units()
	function, which also has a replacement form, and there are
	conversion methods to and from numeric, which also allow the
	specification of units.	 Objects of this class can also be
	stored in data frames now.  A format() method has been added,
	and the print method was revised.

    o	New function environmentName() to give the print name of
	environments such as "namespace:base".
	This is now used by str().

    o	New function env.profile() provides R level access to summary
	statistics on environments.  In a related patch, new.env()
	now allows the user to specify an initial size for a hashed
	environment.

    o	file() can read the X11 clipboard selection as "X11_clipboard"
	on suitable X11-using systems.

    o	file("stdin") is now recognized, and refers to the process's
	'stdin' file stream whereas stdin() refers to the console.
	These may differ, for example for a GUI console, an embedded
	application of R or if --file= has been used.

    o	file_test() is now also available in package utils.
	(It is now private in package tools.)

    o	file.show() gains an 'encoding' argument.

    o	New functions formatUL() and formatOL() in package utils for
	formatting unordered (itemize) and ordered (enumerate) lists.

    o	The statistics reported when gcinfo(TRUE) are now of the amounts
	used (in Mb) and not of the amounts free (which are not really
	relevant when there are no hard limits, only gc trigger points).

    o	New function get_all_vars() to retrieve all the
	(untransformed) variables that the default method of
	model.frame() would use to create the model frame.

    o	interaction() has a new argument 'lex.order'.

    o   initialize() (in methods) now tries to be smarter about
        updating the new instance in place, thereby reducing
        copying.

    o	install.packages(dependencies = NA) is a new default, which is
	to install essential dependencies when installing from
	repositories to a single library.  As a result of this change,
	update.packages() will install any new dependencies of the
	packages it is updating (alongside the package in the same
	library tree).

	If 'lib' is not specified or is specified of length one and
	the chosen location is not a writable directory,
	install.packages() offers to create a personal library
	directory for you if one does not already exist, and to
	install there.

    o	is.atomic, is.call, is.character, is.complex, is.double (== is.real),
	is.environment, is.expression, is.function, is.integer,
	is.list, is.logical, is.null, is.object, is.pairlist,
	is.recursive, is.single and is.symbol (== is.name) are no
	longer internally S3 generic, nor can S4 methods be written
	for them.

	The "factor" methods of is.integer and is.numeric have been
	replaced by internal code.

    o	Added is.raw() for completeness.

    o	l10n_info() also reports if the current locale is Latin-1.

    o	levels<-(), names() and names<-() now dispatch internally for
	efficiency and so no longer have S3 default methods.

    o	.libPaths() now does both tilde and glob expansion.

    o	Functions lm(), glm() loess(), xtabs() and the default method
	of model.frame() coerce their 'formula'	argument (if supplied)
	to a formula.

    o	max(), min() and range() now work with character vectors.

    o	message() has a new argument 'appendLF' to handle messages
	with and without newlines.  There is a new message class
	packageStartupMessage() that can be suppressed separately.

    o	A new function, method.skeleton() writes a skeleton version of
        a call to setMethod() to a file, with correct arguments and
        format, given the name of the function and the method signature.

    o	mode<- and storage.mode<- do slightly less copying.

    o	nls.control(* , printEval = FALSE, warnOnly = FALSE) are two new
	options to help better analyze (non-)convergence of nls(),
	thanks to Kate Mullen.

	nls() and summary(nls()) now contain more information and also
	print information about convergence.

    o	options(device = ) now accepts a function object as well as
	the name of a function.

    o	pdf() supports new values for 'paper' of "US" (same as
	"letter"), "a4r" and "USr" (the latter two meaning rotated to
	landscape).  postscript() also accepts paper = "US".

    o	persp() now respects the graphical pars 'cex.axis', 'cex.lab',
	'font.axis' and 'font.lab'.

    o	New faster internal functions pmax.int() and pmin.int() for
	inputs which are atomic vectors without classes (called by
	pmax/pmin where applicable).

	pmin/pmax are now more likely to work with classed objects:
	they work with POSIXlt datetimes, for example.

    o	postscript() now by default writes grey colors (including black
	and white) via 'setgray', which gives more widely acceptable
	output.	 There are options to write pure RGB, CMYK or gray via
	the new argument 'colormodel'.

    o	rbind.data.frame() now ignores all zero-row inputs, as well as
	zero-column inputs (which it used to do, undocumented).	 This
	is because read.table() can create zero-row data frames with
	NULL columns, and those cannot be extended.

    o	readChar() and writeChar() can now work with a raw vector.

    o	read.table(), write.table() and allies have been moved to package
	utils.

    o	rgb() now accepts the red, green and blue components in a
	single matrix or data frame.

    o	New utility function RShowDoc() in package 'utils' to find and
	display manuals and other documentation files.

    o	New .row_names_info() utility function finds the number of rows
	efficiently for data frames; consequently, dim.data.frame()
	has become very fast for large data frames with 'automatic'
	row names.

    o	RSiteSearch() now also allows to search postings of the 'R-devel'
	mailing list.

    o	screeplot() is now (S3) generic with a default method, thanks
	to a patch from Gavin Simpson.

    o	Experimental 'verbose' argument for selectMethod().  Might be
	replaced later by a better interface for method selection
	inspection.

    o	Added links to source files to the parsing routines, so that
	source() can now echo the original source and comments (rather
	than deparsing).  This affects example() and Sweave() as well.

    o	stack() and unstack() have been moved to package utils.

    o	strptime() now sets the "tzone" attribute on the result if
	tz != "".

    o	str.default() typically prints fewer entries of logical vectors.

    o	The RweaveLatex driver for Sweave() now supports two new
	options: expand=FALSE, to show chunk references in the output,
	and concordance=TRUE, to output the concordance between input
	and output lines.

    o	system() now takes the same set of arguments on all platforms,
	with those which are not applicable being ignored with a
	warning.  Unix-alikes gain 'input' and 'wait', and Windows
	gains 'ignore.stderr'.

    o	system.time() and proc.time() now return an object of class
	"proc_time" with a print() method that returns a POSIX-like
	format with names.

    o	Sys.getenv() has a new argument 'unset' to allow unset and set
	to "" to be distinguished (if the OS does).  The results of
	Sys.getenv() are now sorted (by name).

    o	New function Sys.glob(), a wrapper for the POSIX.2 function
	glob(3) to do wildcard expansion (on systems which have it,
	plus an emulation on Windows).

    o	Sys.setenv() is a new (and preferred) synonym for Sys.putenv().
	The internal C code uses the POSIX-preferred 'setenv' rather
	than 'putenv' where the former is available.

    o	New function Sys.unsetenv() to remove environment variables
	(on systems where unsetenv is implemented or putenv can remove
	variables, such as on Windows).

    o	text(), mtext(), strheight(), strwidth(), legend(), axis(),
	title(), pie(), grid.text() and textGrob() all attempt to
	coerce non-language annotation objects (in the sense of is.object)
	to character vectors.  This is principally intended to cover
	factors and POSIXt and Date objects, and is done via the
	new utility function as.graphicsAnnot() in package grDevices.

    o	tcltk:tk_select.list() now chooses the width to fit the widest item.

    o	{re,un}tracemem() are now primitives for efficiency and so
	migrate from 'utils' to 'base'.

    o	union(), interect(), setdiff() and setequal() now coerce their
	arguments to be vectors (and they were documented only to
	apply to vectors).

    o	uniroot() now works if the zero occurs at one of the ends of
	the interval (suggestion of Tamas Papp).

    o	There is a new function View() for viewing matrix-like
	objects in a spreadsheet, which can be left up whilst R is
	running.

    o	New function withVisible() allows R level access to the
	visibility flag.

    o	zip.file.extract() has been moved to package utils.


    o	A few more cases of subassignment work, e.g. <raw>[] <- <list>
	and <vector>[] <- <expression>, with suitable coercion of the LHS.

    o	There is a warning if \ is used unnecessarily in a string when
	being parsed, e.g. "\." where probably "\\." was intended.
	("\." is valid, but the same as ".".)  Thanks to Bill Dunlap
	for the suggestion.

    o	Introduced the suffix L for integer literals to create
	integer rather than numeric values, e.g. 100L, 0x10L, 1e2L.

    o	Set the parser to give verbose error messages in case of
	syntax errors.

    o	The class "LinearMethodsList" has been extended and will be
	used to create list versions of methods, derived from the
	methods tables (environments).	The older recursive
	"MethodsList" class will be deprecated (by the release of
	2.5.0 if possible).

    o	There are more flexible ways to specify the default library
	search path.  In addition to R_LIBS and .Library, there are
	.Library.site (defaults to R_HOME/site-library) and
	R_LIBS_USER (defaults to a platform- and version-specific
	directory in ~/R).  See ?.libPaths for details.

    o	LAPACK has been updated to version 3.1.0.  This should cause
	only small changes to the output, but do remember that the sign
	of eigenvectors (and principal components) is indeterminate.

    o	PCRE has been updated to version 7.0.

    o	Several functions handle row names more efficiently:

	- read.table() and read.DIF() make use of integer row names
	  where appropriate, and avoid at least one copy in assigning
	  them.

	- data.frame() and the standard as.data.frame() methods avoid
	  generating long dummy row names and then discarding them.

	- expand.grid() and merge() generate compact 'automatic' row
	  names.

	- data.matrix() and as.matrix.data.frame() have a new argument
	  'rownames.force' that by default drops 'automatic' row names.

    o	<data frame>[i, j] is substantially more memory-efficient when
	only a small part of the data frame is selected, especially
	when (part of) a single column is selected.

    o	Command-line R (and Rterm.exe under Windows) accepts the options
	'-f filename', '--file=filename' and '-e expression' to follow
	other script interpreters.  These imply --no-save unless
	--save is specified.

    o	Invalid bytes in character strings in an MBCS now deparse/print
	in the form "\xc1" rather than "<c1>", which means they can be
	parsed/scanned.

    o	Printing functions (without source attributes) and expressions
	now preserves integers (using the L suffix) and NAs (using
	NA_real_ etc where necessary).

    o	The 'internal' objects .helpForCall, .tryHelp and topicName are
	no longer exported from 'utils'.

    o	The internal regex code has been upgraded to glibc 2.5 (from 2.3.6).

    o	Text help now attempts to display files which have an \encoding
	section in the specified encoding via file.show().

    o	R now attempts to keep track of character strings which are
	known to be in Latin-1 or UTF-8 and print or plot them
	appropriately in other locales.	 This is primarily intended
	to make it possible to use data in Western European languages
	in both Latin-1 and UTF-8 locales.  Currently scan(),
	read.table(), readLines(), parse() and source() allow
	encodings to be declared, and console input in suitable
	locales is also recognized.

	New function Encoding() can read or set the declared encodings
	for a character vector.

    o	There have been numerous performance improvements to the data
	editor on both Windows and X11.	 In particular, resizing the
	window works much better on X11.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	symbol.C() and symbol.For() are defunct, and have been replaced
	by wrappers that give a warning.

    o	Calling a builtin function with an empty argument is now always
	an error.

    o	The autoloading of ts() is defunct.

    o	The undocumented reserved word GLOBAL.ENV has been removed.
	(It was yet another way to get the value of the symbol
	.GlobalEnv.)

    o	The deprecated behaviour of structure() in adding a class when
	specifying with "tsp" or "levels" attributes is now defunct.

    o	unix() is now finally defunct, having been deprecated for
	at least seven years.

    o	Sys.putenv() is now deprecated in favour of Sys.setenv(),
	following the POSIX recommendation.

    o	Building R with --without-iconv is deprecated.

    o	Using $ on an atomic vector is deprecated (it was previously
	valid and documented to return NULL).

    o	The use of storage.mode<- for other than standard types (and
        in particular for value "single") is deprecated: use mode<-
	instead.


INSTALLATION

    o	A suitable iconv (e.g. from glibc or GNU libiconv) is
	required.  For 2.5.x only you can build R without it by
	configuring using --without-iconv.

    o	There is support again for building on AIX (tested on 5.2 and 5.3)
	thanks to Ei-ji Nakama.

    o	Autoconf 2.60 or later is used to create 'configure'.  This
	makes a number of small changes, and incorporates the changes
	to the detection of a C99-compliant C compiler backported for
	2.4.1.

    o	Detection of a Java development environment was added such that
	packages don't need to provide their own Java detection. Newly
	added make variables are JAVAC, JAVAH, JAR and JAVA_CPPFLAGS.

	R CMD javareconf was updated to look for the corresponding
	Java tools as well.

	In addition, Java detection honors user-supplied environment
	variables JAVA_CPPFLAGS, JAVA_LIBS and JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    o	Added workaround for reported non-POSIX sh on OSF1.  (PR#9375)

    o	'make install-strip' now works, stripping the executables and
	also the shared libraries and modules on platforms where
	'libtool' knows how to do so.

    o	Building R as a shared library and standalone nmath now
	installs pkg-config files 'libR.pc' and 'libRmath.pc' respectively.

    o	Added test for insufficiently complete implementation of sigaction.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	Functions str2type, type2char and type2str are now available in
	Rinternals.h.

    o	Added support for Objective C in R and packages (if available).

    o	R_ParseVector() has a new 4th argument 'SEXP srcfile' allowing
	source references to be attached to the returned expression list.

    o	Added ptr_R_WriteConsoleEx callback which allows consoles to
	distinguish between regular output and errors/warnings.
	To ensure backward compatibility it is only used if
	ptr_R_WriteConsole is set to NULL.


UTILITIES

    o	Additional Sweave() internal functions are exported to help
	writing new drivers, and RweaveLatexRuncode() is now created
	using a helper function (all from a patch submitted by Seth
	Falcon).

    o	The following additional flags are accessible from R CMD config:
	OBJC, OBJCFLAGS, JAR, JAVA, JAVAC, JAVAH, JAVA_HOME, JAVA_LIBS
	and JAVA_CPPFLAGS.

    o	R CMD build now takes the package name from the DESCRIPTION
	file and not from the directory.  (PR#9266)

    o	checkS3methods() (and hence R CMD check) now checks agreement
	with primitive internal generics, and checks for additional
	arguments in methods where the generic does not have a '...'
	argument.

	codoc() now knows the argument lists of primitive functions.

    o	R CMD INSTALL and R CMD REMOVE now use as the default library
	(if -l is not specified) the first library that would be used
	if R were run in the current environment (and they run R to
	find it).

    o	There is a new front-end Rscript which can be used for #!
	scripts and similar tasks.  See help("Rscript") and 'An
	Introduction to R' for further details.

    o	R CMD BATCH (not Windows) no longer prepends
	'invisible(options(echo = TRUE))' to the input script.  This
	was the default unless --slave is specified and the latter is
	no longer overridden.

	On all OSes it makes use of the -f argument to R, so
	file("stdin") can be used from BATCH scripts.

	On all OSes it reports proc.time() at the end of the script
	unless q() is called with options to inhibit this.

    o	R CMD INSTALL now prepends the installation directory (if
	specified) to the library search path.

    o	Package installation now re-encodes R files and the NAMESPACE
	file if the DESCRIPTION file specifies an encoding, and sets
	the encoding used for reading files in preparing for
	LazyData.  This will help if a package needs to be used in
	(say) both latin1 and UTF-8 locales on different systems.

    o	R CMD check now reports on non-ASCII strings in datasets.
	(These are a portability issue, which can be alleviated by
	marking their encoding: see 'Writing R Extensions'.)

    o	Rdiff now converts CRLF endings in the target file, and
	converts UTF-8 single quotes in either to ASCII quotes.

    o	New recommended package 'codetools' by Luke Tierney provides
	code-analysis tools.  This can optionally be used by 'R CMD
	check' to detect problems, especially symbols which are not
	visible.

    o	R CMD config now knows about LIBnn .

    o	New recommended package 'rcompgen' by Deepayan Sarkar
	provides support for command-line completion under the Unix
	terminal interface (provided readline is enabled) and the
	Windows Rgui and Rterm front ends.


BUG FIXES

    o	gc() can now report quantities of 'Vcells' in excess of 16Gb on
	64-bit systems (rather than reporting NA).

    o	Assigning class "factor" to an object now requires it has
	integer (and not say double) codes.

    o	structure() ensures that objects with added class "factor" have
	integer codes.

    o	The "formula" and "outer" attributes of datasets 'ChickWeight',
	'CO2', 'DNase', 'Indometh', 'Loblolly', 'Orange' and 'Theoph'
	now have an empty environment and not the environment used to
	dump the datasets in the package.

    o	Dataset 'Seatbelts' now correctly has class c("mts", "ts").

    o	str() now labels classes on data frames more coherently.

    o	Several 'special' primitives and .Internals could return
	invisibly if the evaluation of an argument led to the
	visibility flag being turned off.  These included
	as.character(), as.vector(), call(), dim(), dimnames(),
	lapply(), rep(), seq() and seq_along().  Others (e.g. dput()
	and print.default()) could return visibly when this was not
	intended.

    o	Several primitives such as dim() were not checking the number
	of arguments supplied before method dispatch.

    o	Tracing of primitive functions has been corrected.  It should
	now be the case that tracing either works or is not allowed
	for all primitive functions. (Problems remain if you make a
	primitive into a generic when it is being traced.  To be fixed
	later.)

    o	max.col() now omits infinite values in determining the
	relative tolerance.

    o	R CMD Sweave and R CMD Stangle now respond to --help and --version
	like other utilities.

    o	.libPaths() adds only existing directories (as it was
	documented to, but could add non-directories).

    o	setIs() and setClassUnion() failed to find some existing
	subclasses and produced spurious warnings, now fixed.

    o	data.frame() ignored 'row.names' for 0-column data frames, and
	no longer treats an explicit row.names=NULL differently from
	the default value.

    o	identical() looked at the internal structure of the
	'row.names' attribute, and not the value visible at R level.

    o	abline(reg) now also correctly works with intercept-only lm
	models, and abline() warns more when it's called illogically.

    o	warning() was truncating messages at
	getOption("warning.length") - 1 (not as documented), with no
	indication.  It now appends '[... truncated]'.

    o	Stangle/Sweave were throwing spurious warnings if options
	'result' or 'strip.white' were unset.

    o	all.equal() was ignoring 'check.attributes' for list and
	expression targets, and checking only attributes on raw vectors.
	Logical vectors were being compared as if they were numeric,
	(with a mean difference being quoted).

    o	Calculating the number of significant digits in a number was
	itself subject to rounding errors for digits >= 16.  The
	calculation has been changed to err on the side of slightly
	too few significant digits (but still at least 15) rather than
	far too many.  (An example is print(1.001, digits=16).)

    o	unlink() on Unix-alikes failed for paths containing spaces.

    o	substr() and friends treated NA 'start' or 'stop' incorrectly.

    o	merge(x, y, all.y = TRUE) would sometimes incorrectly return
	logical columns for columns only in y when there were no
	common rows.

    o	read.table(fn, col.names=) on an empty file returned NULL
	columns, rather than logical(0) columns (which is what results
	from reading a file with just a header).

    o	grid.[xy]axis(label=logical(0)) failed.

    o	expression() was unnecessarily duplicating arguments.

    o	as.expression(<list>) returned a single-element expression
	vector, which was not compatible with S: it now copies lists
	element-by-element.

    o	supsmu(periodic = TRUE) could segfault.  (PR#9502, detection
	and patch by Bill Dunlap.)

    o	pmax/pmin called with only logical arguments did not coerce to
	numeric, although they were documented to do so (as max/min
	do).

    o	methods() did not know that cbind() and rbind() are internally
	generic.

    o	dim(x) <- NULL removed the names of x, but this was always
	undocumented.  It is not clear that it is desirable but it is
	S-compatible and relied on, so is now documented.

    o	which(x, arr.ind = TRUE) did not return a matrix (as
	documented) if 'x' was an array of length 0.

    o	C-level duplicate() truncated CHARSXPs with embedded nuls.

    o	Partial matching of attributes was not working as documented
	in some cases if there were more than two partial matches or
	if "names" was involved.

    o	data(package=character(0)) was not looking in ./data as
	documented.

    o	summary.mlm() failed if some response names were "" (as can
	easily happen if cbind() is used).

    o	The postscript() and pdf() drivers shared an encoding list
	but used slightly different formats.  This caused problems if
	both were used with the same non-default encoding in the same
	session.  (PR#9517)

    o	The data editor was not allowing Inf, NA and NaN to be entered
	in numerical columns.  It was intended to differentiate
	between empty cells and NAs, but did not do so: it now does
	so for strings.

    o	supsmu() could segfault if all cases had non-finite values.
	(PR#9519)

    o	plnorm(x, lower.tail=FALSE) was returning the wrong tail for
	x <= 0.  (PR#9520)

    o	which.min() would not report a minimum of +Inf, and
	analogously for which.max().  (PR#9522)

    o	'R CMD check' could fail with an unhelpful error when checking
	Rd files for errors if there was only one file and that had a
	serious error.  (PR#9459)

    o	try() has been reimplemented using tryCatch() to solve two
	problems with the original implementation: (i) try() would run
	non-NULL options("error") expressions for errors within a try, and
	(ii) try() would catch user interrupts.

    o	str(obj) could fail when obj contained a dendrogram.

    o	Using <data frame>[, <last column>] <- NULL failed (PR#9565)

    o	choose(n, k) could return non-integer values for integer n and
	small k on some platforms.

    o	nclass.scott(x) and nclass.FD(x) no longer return NaN when var(x)
	or IQR(x) (respectively) is zero.

	hist() now allows breaks = 1 (which the above patch will
	return), but not breaks = Inf (which gave an obscure error).

    o	strptime("%j") now also works for the first days of Feb-Dec.
	(PR#9577)

    o	write.table() now recovers better if 'file' is an unopened
	connection.  (It used to open it for both the column names and
	the data.)

    o	Fixed bug in mosaicplot(sort=) introduced by undocumented
	change in R 2.4.1 (changeset r39655).

    o	contr.treatment(n=0) failed with a spurious error message.
	(It remains an error.)

    o	as.numeric() was incorrectly documented: it is identical to
	as.double.

    o	jitter(rep(-1, 3)) gave NaNs. (PR#9580)

    o	max.col() was not random for a row of zeroes. (PR#9542)

    o	ansari.test(conf.int=TRUE, exact=FALSE) failed.

    o	trace() now works on S3 registered methods, by modifying the
	version in the S3 methods table.

    o	rep(length=1, each=0) segfaulted.

    o	postscript() could overflow a buffer if used with a long
	'command' argument.

    o	The internal computations to copy complete attribute lists did
	not copy the flag marking S4 objects, so the copies no longer
	behaved like S4 objects.

    o	The C code of nlminb() was altering a variable without
	duplicating it.  (This did not affect nlminb() but would have
	if the code was called from a different wrapper.)

    o	smooth(kind = "3RS3R") (the current default) used .C(DUP =
	FALSE) but altered its input argument.  (This was masked by
	duplication in as.double.)

    o	The signature for the predefined S4 method for as.character()
	was missing '...' .

    o	readBin(<raw vector>) could read beyond the end of the vector
	when size-changing was involved.

    o	The C entry point PrintValue (designed to emulate auto-printing)
	would not find show() for use on S4 objects, and did not have
	the same search path (for show(), print() and print() methods)
	as auto-printing.  Also, auto-printing and print() of S4
	objects would fail to find 'show' if the methods namespace was
	loaded but the package was not attached (or otherwise not in
	the search path).

    o	print() (and auto-printing) now recognize S4 objects even when
	'methods' is not loaded, and print a short summary rather than
	dump the internal structure.

    o	Sweave and Stangle had problems due to partial matching of code
	chunk names when run with split=TRUE.

    o	install.packages() on a source package now ensures that
	R CMD INSTALL sees the same library search path as
	install.packages() did when computing dependencies.

    o	density() now ensures its 'y' values are non-negative. (PR#8876)

    o	is.finite() and is.infinite() (and many other primitives)
	are not internally generic and so do not support S4 methods,
	which can no longer be set. (PR#7951)

    o	nls(algorithm = "port") now accepts a list 'start' argument,
	as for the other methods (and as documented).

    o	Standard errors from the "ar" method of predict() could be
	wrong for the last p predictions for models near
	non-stationarity. (PR#9614)

Subject: R 2.5.1 is released
Message-ID: <46839EFC.8070806@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.5.1.tar.gz a short while ago. This is a maintenance
release and fixes a number of mostly minor bugs and platform issues. See 
the full list of changes below.

You can get it (in a short while) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.5.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.

Here is the relevant bit of the NEWS file:

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.5.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   density(1:20, bw = "SJ") now works as bw.SJ() now tries a larger
        search interval than the default (lower, upper) if it does not
        find a solution within the latter.

    o   The output of library() (no arguments) is now sorted by library
        trees in the order of .libPaths() and not alphabetically.

    o   R_LIBS_USER and R_LIBS_SITE feature possible expansion of
        specifiers for R version specific information as part of the
        startup process.

    o   C-level warning calls now print a more informative context,
        as C-level errors have for a while.

    o   There is a new option "rl_word_breaks" to control the way the
        input line is tokenized in the readline-based terminal
        interface for object- and file-name completion.
        This allows it to be tuned for people who use their space bar
        vs those who do not.  The default now allows filename-completion
        with +-* in the filenames.

    o   If the srcfile argument to parse() is not NULL, it will be added
        to the result as a "srcfile" attribute.

    o   It is no longer possible to interrupt lazy-loading (which was
        only at all likely when lazy-loading environments), which
        would leave the object being loaded in an unusable state.
        This is a temporary measure: error-recovery when evaluating
        promises will be tackled more comprehensively in 2.6.0.

INSTALLATION

    o   'make check' will work with --without-iconv, to accommodate
        building on AIX where the system iconv conflicts with
        libiconv and is not compatible with R's requirements.

    o   There is support for 'DESTDIR': see the R-admin manual.

    o   The texinfo manuals are now converted to HTML with a style
        sheet: in recent versions of makeinfo the markup such as @file
        was being lost in the HTML rendering.

    o   The use of inlining has been tweaked to avoid warnings from
        gcc >= 4.2.0 when compiling in C99 mode (which is the default
        from configure).

BUG FIXES

    o   as.dendrogram() failed on objects of class "dendrogram".

    o   plot(type ="s") (or "S") with many (hundreds of thousands)
        of points could overflow the stack.  (PR#9629)

    o   Coercing an S4 classed object to "matrix" (or other basic class)
        failed to unset the S4 bit.

    o   The 'useS4' argument of print.default() had been broken by an
        unrelated change prior to 2.4.1.  This allowed print() and
        show() to bounce badly constructed S4 objects between
        themselves indefinitely.

    o   Prediction of the seasonal component in HoltWinters() was one
        step out at one point in the calculations.

        decompose() incorrectly computed the 'random' component for a
        multiplicative fit.

    o   Wildcards work again in unlink() on Unix-alikes (they did not
        in 2.5.0).

    o   When qr() used pivoting, the coefficient names in qr.coef() were
        not pivoted to match.  (PR#9623)

    o   UseMethod() could crash R if the first argument was not a
        character string.

    o   R and Rscript on Unix-alikes were not accepting spaces in -e
        arguments (even if quoted).

    o   Hexadecimal integer constants (e.g. 0x10L) were not being parsed
        correctly on platforms where the C function atof did not
        accept hexadecimal prefixes (as required by C99, but not
        implemented in MinGW as used by R on Windows).  (PR#9648)

    o   libRlapack.dylib on Mac OS X had no version information and
        sometimes an invalid identification name.

    o   Rd conversion of \usage treated '\\' as a single backslash in
        all but latex: it now acts consistently with the other
        verbatim-like environments (it was never 'verbatim' despite
        the documentation).

        \code{\.} is now rendered as '\.' in all formats, as
        documented (it was not the case for latex conversion).

        codoc() (and checkDocStyle() and checkDocUsage()) now apply
        the same transformations to \usage as Rd conversion does,
        so {, % and \\ in strings in usages will now be related
        correctly to the help files.

    o   rbind() failed if the only data frame had 0 rows. (PR#9657)

    o   <a data.frame>[i, j] could sometimes select the wrong column
        when j is numeric if there are duplicate column names.

    o   sample(x, size, replace=TRUE, prob) had a memory leak if
        10000 < size <= 100000.

    o   x <- cbind(1:2); rownames(x) <- factor(c("A",NA))  now longer
        segfaults.

    o   R CMD BATCH no longer assumes Sys.unsetenv() is supported (it
        is not on older Solaris systems).

    o   median() returned a logical result when it was 'NA': it now
        returns an NA of appropriate type (e.g. integer or double).

    o   grep(fixed = TRUE, perl = TRUE) ignored 'fixed', although it
        was documented to ignore 'perl'
        Same for [g]regexpr and [g]sub.

    o   getNamespaceExports("base") works again.

    o   runmed(c(), 1) no longer segfaults.

    o   qr.coef(QR, b) failed for an LAPACK-produced QR if b was
        integer or for an over-determined system.

        qr.solve() for an under-determined system produces a
        solution with 0 and not NA for columns which are unused.

    o   segments() was not handling full transparency correctly in PDF.
        (PR#9694)

        Nor was arrows().

    o   callGeneric() inside a method with extra arguments {and hence
        currently defined via .local()} now works.

    o   [g]sub(fixed=TRUE, useBytes=FALSE) could substitute in the
        wrong place in an MBCS locale.

        gregexpr() could give incorrect answers in MBCS locales for
        perl = TRUE or fixed = TRUE (unless useBytes = TRUE).

    o   The legacy quartz() device no longer crashes in locator()
        if the user attempts to close the window.

    o   "CGGStackRestore: gstack underflow" warning is no longer shown
        in legacy quartz() device.

    o   formatC() now limits 'digits' to 50 to avoid problems in
        C-level sprintf in some OSes.

    o   seq.int(x, y, by=z) gave 'x' (and not an error) if
        0 > (y-x)/z > -1.

    o   promptClass() now lists methods, including those for generics in
        other attached packages.

    o   Connection-related functions such as readBin() no longer crash
        when supplied with a non-connection object.

    o   as.character.srcref() didn't handle bad srcref objects cleanly.

    o   predict.nls() no longer requires 'newdata' to contain exactly
        the variable names needed to fit the model: variables used on
        the LHS only are no longer required and further variables are
        allowed.

    o   plot.hclust() had a 'out by one' error, and ignored the last
        object when computing the window region (and could overrun
        arrays).

    o   deriv() was creating results with double (and not integer) dims.

    o   The unserialize code (e.g. as called by load()) looked for a
        function findPackageEnv() to set a saved package environment.
        This was missing, but is now supplied.

    o   [cr]bind could segfault when creating a list matrix result.
        (Reported by Martin Morgan.)

    o   besselI(x, nu, exp=TRUE) and besselY(x, nu) could give wrong
        answers for nu < 0. (Reported by Hiroyuki Kawakatsu.)

    o   [g]sub could confuse a trailing byte '\' for a backreference
        in MBCSs where '\' can occur as a trailing byte (not UTF-8 nor
        EUC-JP, but SJIS and the CJK character sets used on Windows).
        (PR#9751)

Subject: useR! 2008
Message-ID: <46B3242F.4060909@R-Project.org>

We are happy to announce that the R user conference

   useR! 2008

is scheduled for August 12-14, 2008, and will take place at the
University of Dortmund.

As for the predecessor conferences, the program will consist of two parts:
invited lectures and user-contributed sessions (abstract submission will
be available online starting from December 2007). Prior to the
conference, there will be tutorials on R (proposals for tutorials should
be sent before 2007-10-31).


INVITED LECTURES

Invited speakers will include

     Peter B?hlmann, John Fox, Kurt Hornik, Gary King, Duncan Murdoch,
     Jean Thioulouse, Graham J. Williams, and Keith Worsley.


USER-CONTRIBUTED SESSIONS

The sessions will be a platform to bring together R users, contributors,
package maintainers and developers in the S spirit that `users are
developers'. People from different fields will show us how they solve
problems with R in fascinating applications.
The sessions are organized by members of the program committee, including

     Micah Altman, Roger Bivand, Peter Dalgaard, Jan de Leeuw,
     Ram?n D?az-Uriarte, Spencer Graves, Leonhard Held, Torsten Hothorn,
     Fran?ois Husson, Christian Kleiber, Friedrich Leisch, Andy Liaw,
     Martin M?chler, Kate Mullen, Ei-ji Nakama, Thomas Petzold,
     Martin Theus, and Heather Turner.

The program will cover topics such as

     * Applied Statistics & Biostatistics
     * Bayesian Statistics
     * Bioinformatics
     * Chemometrics and Computational Physics
     * Data Mining
     * Econometrics & Finance
     * Environmetrics & Ecological Modeling
     * High Performance Computing
     * Machine Learning
     * Marketing & Business Analytics
     * Psychometrics
     * Robust Statistics
     * Sensometrics
     * Spatial Statistics
     * Statistics in the Social and Political Sciences
     * Teaching
     * Visualization & Graphics
     * and many more.


PRE-CONFERENCE TUTORIALS

Before the official program, half-day tutorials will be offered
on Monday, August 11th.
We invite R users to submit proposals for three hour tutorials on
special topics on R. The proposals should give a brief description of
the tutorial, including goals, detailed outline, justification why the
tutorial is important, background knowledge required and potential
attendees. The proposals should be sent before 2007-10-31 to
useR-2008 at R-project.org.


A web page offering more information on the `useR!' conference is
available at

   http://www.R-project.org/useR-2008

Subject: R-2.6.0 is released
Message-ID: <470360AF.8050701@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.6.0.tar.gz a short while ago. This is a development 
release which contains a number of new features. In particular, the handling 
of data with a large number of identical strings should be more memory-efficient.

Also, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list
of changes below.

You can get it (later today) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.5.0.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. In case of 
impatience, try http://www.biostat.ku.dk/~pd/R-release

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.6.0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o   integrate(), nlm(), nlminb(), optim(), optimize() and uniroot()
        now have '...' much earlier in their argument list.  This
        reduces the chances of unintentional partial matching but
        means that the later arguments must be named in full.

    o   The default type for nchar() is now "chars".  This is almost
        always what was intended, and differs from the previous default
        only for non-ASCII strings in a MBCS locale.  There is a new
        argument 'allowNA', and the default behaviour is now to throw
        an error on an invalid multibyte string if type="chars" or
        type="width".

    o   Connections will be closed if there is no R object referring to
        them.  A warning is issued if this is done, either at garbage
        collection or if all the connection slots are in use.

NEW FEATURES

    o   abs(), sign(), sqrt(), floor(), ceiling(), exp() and the gamma,
        trig and hyperbolic trig functions now only accept one
        argument even when dispatching to a Math group method (which
        may accept more than one argument for other group members).

    o   abbreviate() gains a 'method' argument with a new option
        "both.sides" which can make shorter abbreviations.

    o   aggregate.data.frame() no longer changes the group variables
        into factors, and leaves alone the levels of those which are
        factors.  (Inter alia grants the wish of PR#9666.)

    o   The default 'max.names' in all.names() and all.vars() is now
        -1 which means unlimited.  This fixes PR#9873.

    o   as.vector() and the default methods of as.character(),
        as.complex(), as.double(), as.expression(), as.integer(),
        as.logical() and as.raw() no longer duplicate in most cases
        where the object is unchanged.  (Beware: some code has been
        written that invalidly assumes that they do duplicate, often
        when using .C/.Fortran(DUP=FALSE).)

    o   as.complex(), as.double(), as.integer(), as.logical() and
        as.raw() are now primitive and internally generic for
        efficiency. They no longer dispatch on S3 methods for
        as.vector() (which was never documented).  as.real() and
        as.numeric() remain as alternative names for as.double().

        expm1(), log(), log1p(), log2(), log10(), gamma(), lgamma(),
        digamma() and trigamma() are now primitive.  (Note that logb()
        is not.)

        The Math2 and Summary groups (round, signif, all, any, max, min,
        summ, prod, range) are now primitive.

        See under METHODS PACKAGE below for some consquences for S4 methods.

    o   apropos() now sorts by name and not by position on the search
        path.

    o   attr() gains an 'exact = TRUE' argument to disable partial
        matching.

    o   bxp() now allows 'xlim' to be specified. (PR#9754)

    o   C(f, SAS) now works in the same way as C(f, treatment), etc.

    o   chol() is now generic.

    o   dev2bitmap() has a new option to go via PDF and so allow
        semi-transparent colours to be used.

    o   dev.interactive() regards devices with the displaylist enabled
        as interactive, and packages can register the names of their
        devices as interactive via deviceIsInteractive().

    o   download.packages() and available.packages() (and functions
        which use them) now support in 'repos' or 'contriburl' either
        file: plus a general path (including drives on a UNC path on
        Windows) or a file:/// URL in the same way as url().

    o   dQuote() and sQuote() are more flexible, with rendering
        controlled by the new option 'useFancyQuotes'.  This includes
        the ability to have TeX-style rendering and directional quotes
        (the so-called 'smart quotes') on Windows.  The default is to
        use directional quotes in UTF-8 locales (as before) and in the
        Rgui console on Windows (new).

    o   duplicated() and unique() and their methods in base gain an
        additional argument 'fromLast'.
    o   fifo() no longer has a default 'description' argument.

        fifo("") is now implemented, and works in the same way as file("").

    o   file.edit() and file.show() now tilde-expand file paths on all
        interfaces (they used to on some and not others).

    o   The find() argument is now named 'numeric' and not 'numeric.':
        the latter was needed to avoid warnings about name clashes
        many years ago, but partial matching was used.

    o   stats:::.getXlevels() confines attention to factors since some
        users expected R to treat unclass(<a factor>) as a numeric
        vector.

    o   grep(), strsplit() and friends now warn if incompatible sets
        of options are used, instead of silently using the documented
        priority.

    o   gsub()/sub() with perl = TRUE now preserves attributes from the
        argument x on the result.

    o   is.finite() and is.infinite() are now S3 and S4 generic.

    o   jpeg(), png(), bmp() (Windows), dev2bitmap() and bitmap() have
        a new argument 'units' to specify the units of 'width' and
        'height'.

    o   levels() is now generic (levels<- has been for a long time).

    o   Loading serialized raw objects with load() is now considerably
        faster.

    o   New primitive nzchar() as a faster alternative to
        nchar(x) > 0 (and avoids having to convert to wide chars in
        a MBCS locale and hence consider validity).

    o   The way old.packages() and hence update.packages() handle
        packages with different versions in multiple package
        repositories has been changed.  The first package encountered
        was selected, now the one with highest version number.

    o   optim(method = "L-BFGS-B") now accepts zero-length parameters,
        like the other methods.  Also, method = "SANN" no longer
        attempts to optimize in this case.

    o   New options 'showWarnCalls' and 'showErrorCalls' to give a
        concise traceback on warnings and errors.  showErrorCalls=TRUE
        is the default for non-interactive sessions.  Option
        'showNCalls' controls how abbreviated the call sequence is.

    o   New options 'warnPartialMatchDollar', 'warnPartialMatchArgs'
        and 'warnPartialMatchAttr' to help detect the unintended use
        of partial matching in $, argument matching and attr()
        respectively.

    o   A device named as a character string in options(device =) is now
        looked for in the grDevices name space if it is not visible
        from the global environment.

    o   pmatch(x, y, duplicates.ok = TRUE) now uses hashing and so is
        much faster for large x and y when most matches are exact.

    o   qr() is now generic.

    o   It is now a warning to have an non-integer object for
        .Random.seed: this indicates a user had been playing with it,
        and it has always been documented that users should only save
        and restore it.

    o   New higher-order functions Reduce(), Filter() and Map().

    o   [g]regexpr() gain an 'ignore.case' argument for consistency with
        grep().  (This does change the positional matching
        of arguments, but no instances of positional matching beyond
        the second were found.)

    o   relist() utility, an S3 generic with several methods, providing
        an 'inverse' for unlist(); thanks to a code proposal from
        Andrew Clausen.

    o   require() now returns invisibly.

    o   The interface to reshape() has been revised, allowing some
        simplified forms that did not work before, and somewhat
        improved error handling. A new argument 'sep' has been
        introduced to replace simple usages of 'split' (the old
        features are retained).

    o   rmultinom() uses a high-precision accumulator where available,
        and so is more likely to give the same result on different
        platforms (although it is still possible to get different
        results, and the result may differ from previous versions of R).

    o   row() and col() now work on matrix-like objects such as data
        frames, not just matrices.

    o   Rprof() allows smaller values of 'interval' on machines that
        support it: for example modern Linux systems support
        interval = 0.001.

    o   sample() now requires its first argument 'x' to be numeric
        (in the sense of is.numeric()) as well as of length 1 and >= 1
        before it is regarded as shorthand for 1:x.

    o   sessionInfo() now provides details about package name spaces
        that are loaded but not attached.  The output of sessionInfo
        has been improved to make it easier to read when it is
        inadvertently wrapped after being pasted into an email
        message.

    o   setRepositories() has a new argument 'ind' to allow selections
        to be made programmatically.

    o   showMethods() has a "smart" default for 'inherited' such that
        showMethods(<genfun>, incl = TRUE)  becomes a useful short cut.

    o   sprintf() no longer has a output string length limit.

    o   storage.mode<- is now primitive, and hence makes fewer copies
        of an object (none if the mode is unchanged).  It is a little
        less general than mode<-, which remains available.  (See also
        the entry under DEFUNCT below.)

    o   sweep() gains an argument 'check.margin = TRUE' which warns
        about mismatched dimensions.

    o   The mathematical annotation facility (plotmath) now recognises
        a symbol() function which forces the font to be a symbol font.
        This allows access to all characters in the Adobe Symbol
        encoding within plotmath expressions.

    o   For OSes that cannot unset environment variables, Sys.unsetenv()
        sets the value to "", with a warning.

    o   New function Sys.which(), an interface to 'which' on
        Unix-alikes and an emulation on Windows.

    o   On Unix-alikes, system(, intern = TRUE) reports on very long
        lines that may be truncated, giving the line number of the
        content being read.

    o   termplot() has a default for 'ask' that uses dev.interactive().

        It allows 'ylim' to be set, or computed to cover all the
        plots to be made (the new default) or computed for each plot
        (the previous default).

    o   uniroot(f, *) is slightly faster for non-trivial f() because it
        computes f(lower) and f(upper) only once, and it has new optional
        arguments 'f.lower' and 'f.upper' by which the caller can pass these.

    o   unlink() is now internal, using common POSIX code on all platforms.

    o   unsplit() now works with lists of dataframes.

    o   The vcov() methods for classes "gls" and "nlme" have migrated to
        package 'nlme'.

    o   vignette() has a new argument 'all' to choose between showing
        vignettes in attached packages or in all installed packages.

    o   New function within(), which is like with(), except that it
        returns modified versions back of lists and data frames.

    o   X11(), postscript() (and hence bitmap()), xfig(), jpeg(), png()
        and the Windows devices win.print(), win.metafile() and bmp()
        now warn (once at first use) if semi-transparent colours are
        used (rather than silently treating them as fully
        transparent).

    o   New function xspline() to provide base graphics support of
        X-splines (cf grid.xspline).

    o   New function xyTable() does the 2D gridding "computations" used by
        sunflowerplot().

    o   Rd conversion to HTML and CHM now makes use of classes, which
        are set in the stylesheets.  Editing R.css will change the
        styles used for \env, \option, \pkg etc.  (CHM styles are set
        at compilation time.)

    o   The documented arguments of '%*%' have been changed to be x
        and y, to match S and the implicit S4 generic.

    o   If members of the Ops group (the arithmetic, logical and
        comparison operators) and '%*%' are called as functions,
        e.g. '>'(x, y), positional matching is always used.  (It used
        to be the case that positional matching was used for the
        default methods, but names would be matched for S3 and S4
        methods and in the case of '!' the argument name differed
        between S3 and S4 methods.)

    o   Imports environments of name spaces are named (as
        "imports:foo"), and so are known e.g. to environmentName().

    o   Package 'stats4' uses lazy-loading not SaveImage (which is now
        deprecated).

    o   Installing help for a package now parses the .Rd file only
        once, rather than once for each type.

    o   PCRE has been updated to version 7.2.

    o   bzip2 has been updated to version 1.0.4.

    o   gettext has been updated to version 0.16.1.

    o   There is now a global CHARSXP cache, R_StringHash.  CHARSXPs
        are no longer duplicated and must not be modified in place.
        Developers should strive to only use mkChar (and mkString) for
        creating new CHARSXPs and avoid use of allocString.  A new
        macro, CallocCharBuf, can be used to obtain a temporary char
        buffer for manipulating character data.  This patch was
        written by Seth Falcon.

    o   The internal equivalents of as.complex, as.double, as.integer
        and as.logical used to handle length-1 arguments now accept
        character strings (rather than report that this is
        'unimplemented').

    o   Lazy-loading a package is now substantially more efficient (in
        memory saved and load time).

    o   Various performance improvements lead to a 45% reduction
        in the startup time without 'methods' (and one-sixth with -
        'methods' now takes 75% of the startup time of a default session).

    o   The [[ subsetting operator now has an argument 'exact' that
        allows programmers to disable partial matching (which will in
        due course become the default).  The default value is exact=NA
        which causes a warning to be issued when partial matching
        occurs.  When exact = TRUE, no partial matching will be
        performed.  When exact = FALSE, partial matching can occur and
        no warning will be issued.  This patch was written by Seth
        Falcon.

    o   Many of the C-level warning / error messages (e.g. from
        subscripting) have been re-worked to give more detailed
        information on either the location or the cause of the
        problem.

    o   The S3 and S4 Math groups have been harmonized.  Functions
        log1p(), expm1(), log10() and log2() are members of the S3
        group, and sign(), log1p(), expm1(), log2(), cummax(),
        cummin(), digamma(), trigamma() and trunk() are members of the
        S4 group.  gammaCody() is no longer in the S3 Math group.
        They are now all primitive.

    o   The initialization of the random-number stream makes use of the
        sub-second part of the current time where available.

        Initialization of the 1997 Knuth TAOCP generator is now done
        in R code, avoiding some C code whose licence status has been
        questioned.

    o   The reporting of syntax errors has been made more user-
        friendly.

    o   Packages using 'methods' have to have been installed in R 2.4.0
        or later (when various internal representations were changed).

    o   Internally generic primitives no longer dispatch S4 methods on
        S3 objects.

    o   load() and restoring a workspace attempt to detect and warn on
        the loading of pre-2.4.0 S4 objects.

    o   Making functions primitive changes the semantics of S4
        dispatch: these no longer dispatch on classes based on types
        but do dispatch whenever the function in the base name space is
        called.

        This applies to as.complex(), as.integer(), as.logical(),
        as.numeric(), as.raw(), expm1(), log(), log1p(), log2(),
        log10(), gamma(), lgamma(), digamma() and trigamma(), as
        well as the Math2 and Summary groups.

        Because all members of the group generics are now primitive,
        they are all S4 generic and setting an S4 group generic does
        at last apply to all members and not just those already made
        S4 generic.

        as.double() and as.real() are identical to as.numeric(), and
        now remain so even if S4 methods are set on any of them.
        Since 'as.numeric' is the traditional name used in S4,
        currently methods must be exported from a NAMESPACE for
        'as.numeric' only.

    o   The S4 generic for '!' has been changed to have signature (x)
        (was (e1)) to match the documentation and the S3 generic.
        setMethod() will fix up methods defined for (e1), with a
        warning.

    o   The "structure" S4 class now has methods that implement the
        concept of structures as described in the Blue Book--that
        element-by-element functions and operators leave structure
        intact unless they change the length.  The informal behavior
        of R for vectors with attributes was inconsistent.

    o   The implicitGeneric() function and relatives have been added to
        specify how a function in a package should look when methods are
        defined for it.  This will be used to ensure that generic versions
        of functions in R core are consistent.  See ?implicitGeneric.

    o   Error messages generated by some of the functions in the methods
        package provide the name of the generic to provide more
        contextual information.

    o   It is now possible to use setGeneric(useAsDefault = FALSE) to
        define a new generic with the name of a primitive function
        (but having no connection with the primitive).

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o   $ on an atomic vector now gives a warning that it is 'invalid'.
        It remains deprecated, but may be removed in R >= 2.7.0.

    o   storage.mode(x) <- "real" and storage.mode(x) <- "single" are
        defunct: use instead storage.mode(x) <- "double" and
        mode(x) <- "single".

    o   In package installation, SaveImage: yes is deprecated in
        favour of LazyLoad: yes.

    o   seemsS4Object (methods package) is deprecated in favour of isS4().

    o   It is planned that [[exact=TRUE]] will become the default in
        R 2.7.0.

UTILITIES

    o   checkS3methods() (invoked by R CMD check) now checks the
        arguments of methods for primitive members of the S3 group
        generics.

    o   R CMD check now does a recursive copy on the 'tests' directory.

    o   R CMD check now warns on non-ASCII .Rd files without an
        \encoding field, rather than just on ones that are definitely
        not from an ISO-8859 encoding.  This agrees with the
        long-standing stipulation in 'Writing R Extensions', and
        catches some packages with UTF-8 man pages.

    o   R CMD check now warns on DESCRIPTION files with a non-portable
        Encoding field, or with non-ASCII data and no Encoding field.

    o   R CMD check now loads all the 'Suggests' and 'Enhances'
        dependencies to reduce warnings about non-visible objects, and
        also emulates standard functions (such as shell()) on
        alternative R platforms.

    o   R CMD check now (by default) attempts to latex the vignettes
        rather than just weave and tangle them: this will give a NOTE
        if there are latex errors.

    o   R CMD check computations no longer ignore Rd \usage entries for
        functions for extracting or replacing parts of an object, so S3
        methods should use the appropriate \method{} markup.

    o   R CMD check now checks for CR (as well as CRLF) line endings in
        C/C++/Fortran source files, and for non-LF line endings in
        Makefile[.in] and Makevars[.in] in the package 'src'
        directory.  R CMD build will correct non-LF line endings in
        source files and in the make files mentioned.

    o   Rdconv now warns about unmatched braces rather than silently
        omitting sections containing them.  (Suggestion by Bill
        Dunlap, PR#9649)

        Rdconv now renders (rather than ignores) \var{} inside \code{}
        markup in latex conversion.

        R CMD  Rdconv gains a --encoding argument to set the default
        encoding for conversions.

    o   The list of CRAN mirrors now has a new (manually maintained)
        column "OK" which flags mirrors that seem to be OK, only those
        are used by chooseCRANmirror(). The now exported function
        getCRANmirrors() can be used to get all known mirrors or only
        the ones that are OK.

    o   R CMD SHLIB gains arguments --clean and --preclean to clean up
        intermediate files after and before building.

    o   R CMD config now knows about FC and FCFLAGS (used for F9x
        compilation).

    o   R CMD Rdconv now does a better job of rendering quotes in
        titles in HTML, and \sQuote and \dQuote into text on Windows.

C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o   New utility function alloc3DArray similar to allocMatrix.

    o   The entry point R_seemsS4Object in Rinternals.h has not been
        needed since R 2.4.0 and has been removed.  Use IS_S4_OBJECT
        instead.

    o   Applications embedding R can use R_getEmbeddingDllInfo() to
        obtain DllInfo for registering symbols present in the
        application itself.

    o   The instructions for making and using standalone libRmath have
        been moved to the R Installation and Administration manual.

    o   CHAR() now returns (const char *) since CHARSXPs should no
        longer be modified in place.  This change allows compilers to
        warn or error about improper modification.  Thanks to Herve
        Pages for the suggestion.

    o   acopy_string is a (provisional) new helper function that
        copies character data and returns a pointer to memory
        allocated using R_alloc.  This can be used to create a copy of
        a string stored in a CHARSXP before passing the data on to a
        function that modifies its arguments.

    o   asLogical, asInteger, asReal and asComplex now accept STRSXP
        and CHARSXP arguments, and asChar accepts CHARSXP.

    o   New R_GE_str2col() exported via R_ext/GraphicsEngine.h for
        external device developers.

    o   doKeybd and doMouseevent are now exported in GraphicsDevice.h.

    o   R_alloc now has first argument of type 'size_t' to support
        64-bit platforms (e.g. Win64) with a 32-bit 'long' type.

    o   The type of the last two arguments of getMatrixDimnames (non-API
        but mentioned in R-exts.texi and in Rinternals.h) has been
        changed to 'const char **' (from char **).

    o   R_FINITE now always resolves to the function call R_finite in
        packages (rather than sometimes substituting isfinite).  This
        avoids some issues where R headers are called from C++ code
        using features tested on the C compiler.

    o   The advice to include R headers from C++ inside extern "C" {}
        has been changed.  It is nowadays better *not* to wrap the
        headers, as they include other headers which on some OSes
        should not be wrapped.

    o   Rinternals.h no longer includes a substantial set of C headers.
        All but ctype.h and errno.h are included by R.h which is supposed
        to be used before Rinternals.h.

    o   Including C system headers can be avoided by defining NO_C_HEADERS
        before including R headers.  This is intended to be used from
        C++ code, and you will need to include C++ equivalents such as
        <cmath> before the R headers.

INSTALLATION

    o   The 'test-Lapack' test is now part of 'make check'.

    o   The 'stat' system call is now required, along with 'opendir'
        (which had long been used but not tested for).  ('make check'
        would have failed in earlier versions without these calls.)

    o   'evince' is now considered as a possible PDF viewer.

    o   'make install-strip' now also strips the DLLs in the standard
        packages.

    o   Perl 5.8.0 (released in July 2002) or later is now required.
        (R 2.4.0 and later have in fact required 5.6.1 or later.)

    o   The C function 'finite' is no longer used: we expect a C99
        compiler which will have 'isfinite'.  (If that is missing, we
        test separately for NaN, Inf and -Inf.)

    o   A script/executable 'texi2dvi' is now required on Unix-alikes:
        it is part of the texinfo distribution.

    o   Files texinfo.tex and txi-en.tex are no longer supplied in
        doc/manual (as the latest versions have an incompatible
        licence).  You will need to ensure that your texinfo and/or
        TeX installations supply them.

    o   wcstod is now required for MBCS support.

    o   There are some experimental provisions for building on Cygwin.

PACKAGE INSTALLATION

    o   The encoding declared in the DESCRIPTION file is now used as
        the default encoding for .Rd files.

    o   A standard for specifying package license information in the
        DESCRIPTION License field was introduced, see 'Writing R
        Extensions'.  In addition, files LICENSE or LICENCE in a package
        top-level source directory are now installed (so putting copies
        into the 'inst' subdirectory is no longer necessary).

    o   install.packages() on a Unix-alike now updates
        doc/html/packages.html only if packages are installed to
        .Library (by that exact name).

    o   R CMD INSTALL --clean now runs SHLIB --clean to do the clean
        up (unless there is a src/Makefile), and this will remove
        $(OBJECTS) (which might have been redefined in Makevars).

        R CMD INSTALL --preclean cleans up the sources after a
        previous installation (as if that had used --clean) before
        attempting to install.

        R CMD INSTALL will now run R CMD SHLIB in the 'src' directory
        if src/Makevars is present, even if there are no source files
        with known extensions.

    o   If there is a file src/Makefile, src/Makevars is now ignored
        (it could be included by src/Makefile if desired), and it is
        preceded by etc/Makeconf rather than share/make/shlib.mk.
        Thus the makefiles read are R_HOME/etc/Makeconf, src/Makefile
        in the package and then any personal Makevars files.

    o   R CMD SHLIB used to support the use of 'OBJS' in Makevars, but
        this was changed to 'OBJECTS' in 2001.  The undocumented
        alternative of 'OBJS' has finally been removed.

    o   R CMD check no longer issues a warning about no data sets
        being present if a lazyload db is found (as determined by the
        presence of Rdata.rdb, Rdata.rds, and Rdata.rdx in the 'data'
        subdirectory.

BUG FIXES

    o   charmatch() and pmatch() used to accept non-integer values for
        'nomatch' even though the return value was documented to be
        integer.  Now 'nomatch' is coerced to integer (rather than the
        result being coerced to the type of 'nomatch').

    o   match.call() no longer 'works' outside a function unless
        'definition' is supplied.  (Under some circumstances it used
        to 'work', matching itself.)

    o   The formula methods of boxplot, cdplot, pairs and spineplot
        now attach 'stats' so that model.frame() is visible where
        they evaluate it.

    o   Date-time objects are no longer regarded as numeric by
        is.numeric().

    o   methods("Math") did not work if 'methods' was not attached.

    o   readChar() read an extra empty item (or more than one) beyond
        the end of the source; in some conditions it would terminate
        early when reading an item of length 0.

    o   Added a promise evaluation stack so interrupted promise
        evaluations can be restarted.

    o   R.version[1:10] now nicely prints.

    o   In the methods package, prototypes are now inherited for the
        .Data "slot"; i.e., for classes that contain one of the basic
        data types.

    o   <data frame>[[i, j]] now works if 'i' is character.

    o   write.dcf() no longer writes NA fields (PR#9796), and works
        correctly on empty descriptions.

    o   pbeta(x, log.p = TRUE) now has improved accuracy in many cases,
        and so have functions depending on it such as pt(), pf() and
        pbinom().

    o   mle() had problems with the L-BFGS-B in the no-parameter case
        and consequentially also when profiling 1-parameter models
        (fix thanks to Ben Bolker).

    o   Two bugs fixed in methods that in involve the "..." argument in
        the generic function: previously failed to catch methods that
        just dropped the "..."; and use of callGeneric() with no arguments
        failed in some circumstances when "..." was a formal argument.

    o   sequence() now behaves more reasonably, although not
        back-compatibly for zero or negative input.

    o   nls() now allows more peculiar but reasonable ways of being called,
        e.g., with data=list(<uneven lengths>) or a model without variables.

    o   match.arg() was not behaving as documented when
        several.ok=TRUE (PR#9859), gave spurious warnings when 'arg'
        had the wrong length and was incorrectly documented (exact
        matches are returned even when there is more than one partial
        match).

    o   The data.frame method for split<-() was broken.

    o   The test for -D__NO_MATH_INLINES was badly broken and returned
        true on all non-glibc platforms and false on all glibc ones
        (whether they were broken or not).

    o   LF was missing after the last prompt when --quiet was used without
        --slave. Use --slave when no final LF is desired.

    o   Fixed bug in initialisation code in 'grid' package for
        determining the boundaries of shapes.  Problem reported
        by Hadley Wickham;  symptom was error message:
        "Polygon edge not found".

    o   str() is no longer slow for large POSIXct objects.  Its output
        is also slightly more compact for such objects; implementation
        via new optional argument 'give.head'.

    o   strsplit(*, fixed=TRUE), potentially iconv() and internal string
        formatting is now faster for large strings, thanks to report
        PR#9902 by John Brzustowski.

    o   de.restore() gave a spurious warning for matrices (Ben Bolker)

    o   plot(fn, xlim=c(a,b)) would not set "from" and "to" properly
        when plotting a function.  The argument lists to curve() and
        plot.function() have been modified slightly as part of the
        fix.

    o   julian() was documented to work with POSIXt origins, but did
        not work with POSIXlt ones.  (PR#9908)

    o   Dataset HairEyeColor has been corrected to agree with
        Friendly (2000): the change involves the breakdown of the
        Brown hair / Brown eye cell by Sex, and only totals over Sex
        are given in the original source.

    o   Trailing spaces are now consistently stripped from \alias{}
        entries in .Rd files, and this is now documented.  (PR#9915)

    o   .find.packages(), packageDescription() and sessionInfo()
        assumed that attached environments named "package:foo" were
        package environments, although misguided users could use such
        a name in attach().

    o   spline() and splinefun() with method = "periodic" could return
        incorrect results when length(x) was 2 or 3.

    o   getS3method() could fail if the method name contained a regexp
        metacharacter such as "+".

    o   help(<a character vector>) now uses the name and not the
        value of the vector unless it has length exactly one, so
        e.g. help(letters) now gives help on 'letters'.
        (Related to PR#9927)

    o   Ranges in chartr() now work better in CJK locales, thanks to
        Ei-ji Nakama.

Subject: useR! 2008 - last call for tutorial proposals
Message-ID: <472A116A.9080106@statistik.uni-dortmund.de>

As most of you already know from a previous announcement, the R user 
conference

    useR! 2008

is scheduled for August 12-14, 2008, and will take place at the
University of Dortmund.



    PRE-CONFERENCE TUTORIALS


Before the official program, half-day tutorials will be offered
on Monday, August 11th. We invite R users to submit proposals for three 
hour tutorials on special topics on R. The proposals should give a brief 
description of the tutorial, including goals, detailed outline, 
justification why the tutorial is important, background knowledge 
required and potential attendees.

This is the last call for submitting proposals for pre-conference 
tutorials to useR-2008 at R-project.org. The proposals should be sent 
before 2007-11-09.


A web page offering more information on the `useR!' conference is
available at

    http://www.R-project.org/useR-2008


We hope to meet you in Dortmund!

Subject: R-2.6.1 is released
Message-ID: <474ADA7E.7030209@biostat.ku.dk>

I've rolled up R-2.6.1.tar.gz a short while ago.

This is a maintenance release and fixes a number of mostly minor bugs
and platform issues, as well as a couple of major problems.

Probably, the most important issues were
- save-to-postscript on Windows
- tcltk event loop with X11
- build issue on recent MacOSX

See the full list of changes below.

You can get it (in a short while) from

http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.6.1.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries
for various platforms will appear in due course.

        For the R Core Team

Here is the relevant bit of the NEWS file:

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.6.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   The "data.frame" and "factor" methods for [[ now support
        the 'exact' argument introduced in 2.6.0.

    o   plot.lm() gains a new argument 'cex.caption' to allow the
        size of the captions to be controlled.

    o   A series of changes make the CHARSXP cache introduced in 2.6.0
        faster (and in some cases many times faster) in sessions with
        a large number (e.g. a million) of unique character strings,
        and also if there are many empty strings.

    o   embedFonts(), bitmap() and dev2bitmap() explicitly turn off
        auto-rotation in Ghostscript when generating PDF.

    o   The canonical architecture is no longer checked when loading
        packages using a non-empty sub-architecture, since it is
        possible to (e.g.) build packages for i386-pc-linux-gnu on both
        that architecture and on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.

    o   Deparsing will (if option warnIncomplete is set) warn on
        strings longer than the parser limit (8192 bytes).

    o   url() now uses the UserAgent header in http transactions in
        the same way as download.file() (making use of option
        "HTTPUserAgent").

BUG FIXES

    o   iconv() is again able to translate character strings with
        embedded nuls (such as those in UCS-2).

    o   new.packages() and update.packages() failed when called on an
        empty library, since old.packages() threw an error.
        old.packages() now returns NULL (as documented) in that case.

    o   Builds on Mac OS X 10.4 or higher now allocate enough space
        in the binary headers to relocate dependent libraries into the
        framework.

    o   R CMD build now computes the exclusion list on the copy it
        makes: this avoids problems if the original sources contain
        symbolic links (which are resolved in the copy).  Thanks to
        Michael Lawrence for diagnosis and patch.

    o   object.size() had slightly too low a size for objects of type "S4".

    o   symbol() in plotmath expressions was only accepting valid
        character strings, which made it impossible to specify symbols
        such as aleph (obtained by symbol("\300")) in a UTF-8 locale.

    o   An event handling issue caused autorepeat functions to
        misbehave with tcltk (notably scrollbars).

    o   plot(sin, -5, 5) gives ylab 'sin(x)' again, where it resulted
        in 'x(x)' in 2.6.0.  Further,  plot(sin)  again plots from
        [0,1] also in cases where a previously used coordinate system
        differs.

    o   curve() with unspecified 'from', 'to' and 'xlim' now reuses the
        previous x limits, and not slightly larger ones.

    o   It was intended that R code filenames in packages should start
        with an ASCII letter or digits (and R CMD INSTALL uses that),
        but the test used in R CMD build ([A-Za-z0-9]) was
        locale-specific (and excluded t to y in Estonian, for
        example).  (PR#10351)

    o   'R CMD build' could misbehave when faced with files with CRLF
        line endings *and* no line ending on the final line of the
        file, removing the last byte of the file.

    o   DF[i, j] failed in 2.6.0 if j was a logical vector selecting a
        single column.

    o   Unix x11() would fail if a valid 'display' was specified but
        DISPLAY was unset. (PR#10379)

    o   postscript() was not always ignoring .Postscript.Options in
        the workspace (where it should not have occurred).

    o   help.search() would give an error if it found a badly
        installed package, even if 'package' was not specified.

    o   tclServiceMode() (package tcltk) now works under Unix-alikes.
        (Although documented, it used only to work under Windows.)

    o   As Mac OS X 10.5.0 comes with incompatible /bin/sh shell, we
        force SHELL=/bin/bash (which is ok) in that case. [Only for
        2.6.x: another solution is used in 2.7.0.]

    o   Deliberately using malformed source attributes no longer
        causes deparsing/printing of functions to crash R. (PR#10437)

    o   R CMD check and R CMD INSTALL now work with (some) directory
        names containing spaces.

    o   choose(n, k) gave incorrect values for negative n and small k.

    o   plot.ts(x,y) could use wrong default labels; fixed thanks to
        Antonio, Fabio di Narzo.

    o   reshape() got column names out of sync with contents in some
        cases; found by Antonio, Fabio Di Narzo.

    o   ar(x) for short 'x' (i.e. length <= 10) could fail because the
        default 'order.max' was >= length(x) which is non-sensical.

    o   Keyboard events in getGraphicsEvent() could cause stack
        imbalance errors (PR#10453)
